272676,We had a room with a kitchen so, it was large. There was a kitchen, living room, and bedroom. In the kitchen, there was a fridge, rice cooker, and portable stove top available. The bed was comfortable. For the location, I'd say this is one of the better hotels in that area compared to others. They were still doing construction on the main floor. At times, there were ants on the tables in our room and I found a bug in our bed. The walls seemed a bit dirty. The room is not soundproof. The water takes a long time to heat up and the shower door does not keep the water inside the shower very well. So when you take a shower, the water flows into the bathroom where the sink and toilet are. No bar of soap available for the sink. ####[['we had a room with a kitchen so, it was large. there was a kitchen, living room, and bedroom', 'facility', 'positive'], ['in the kitchen, there was a fridge, rice cooker, and portable stove top available', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the bed was comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ["for the location, i'd say this is one of the better hotels in that area compared to others", 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there were ants on the tables in our room and i found a bug in our bed', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the walls seemed a bit dirty. the room is not soundproof', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the water takes a long time to heat up and the shower door does not keep the water inside the shower very well', 'facility', 'negative'], ['when you take a shower, the water flows into the bathroom where the sink and toilet are', 'facility', 'negative'], ['no bar of soap available for the sink', 'facility', 'negative']]

272046,The room is fine, a bit small but perfectly acceptable. The view however is magnificent. The small balcony is a nice touch. Breakfast is good and plenty. The owner was extremely helpful and the best part about this homestay. He picked us up at the bus station the minute the bus arrived. He gave us good recommendations about tours in the area. Every time we asked a question through Whatsapp, he responded very quickly. We could use a motorbike from the homestay during our whole stay. He booked our tours and our bus to Ninh Binh, at a lower price than normal, for us. When we came back from our tour the last day (after we checked out) we could use an empty room to shower and relax. He drove us to the bus station and arrived literally the second the bus was there. He even helped putting the luggage on the bus and made sure we could get on the bus first. This homestay is barely more expensive than a bed in the hostels downtown, but you get above-excellent service. Must-stay in Phong Nha! The bathroom needs a renovation: everything was a bit loose and there was quite a bit of lime scale.

273064,bed space was large and private it was the bare minimum for a hostel but good enough. the staff was sleeping there so I felt safe and the secure storage space was large enough to fit all 3 bags,it was cheap and I was able to check in around 11pm even after I was warned it might be a problem they had a small sign and hard to findthey had a skinny entrance filled with stuff. they had no kitchen or common areas to hang with friends but a small balcony with 2 tables and a few chairs. it looked creepy and scary at first but after my first night I was surprisingly very happy staying there. don't judge a book by its cover ####[['bed space was large and private it was the bare minimum for a hostel but good enough', 'facility', 'positive'], ['they had no kitchen or common areas to hang with friends but a small balcony with 2 tables and a few chairs', 'facility', 'neutral'], [' it looked creepy and scary at first but after my first night i was surprisingly very happy staying there', 'experience', 'positive']]

275939,Overall, it's an average 4-star hotel. Everything is decent and nice. The special part about this hotel is the infinity pool with the valley view. Bathtub is a plus too. 1. Breakfast - the breakfast was just a normal serve. With that price, I would expect something the same level as Hoi An hotel. The selections were limited and simple. 2. Construction noise - booked the valley view room with extra price, but the construction noise and view are overwhelmed. Vietnamese are hardworking people, and their construction continued even during the weekend. 3. Air condition - can't customise the air cond, and sometimes it's still freezing in April.

275486,The staff was really nice and always ready to help! The accommodation is on a cute quiet street with a lot of street food vendors nearby. You can get to more touristy area in 15min by walking. I think the location definitely offers “best of both worlds”.I would recommend doing laundry here as well. The room also had a tv that is connected to Wi Fi so you can watch Netflix or You Tube. It definitely has a hotel vibe not hostel so it’s quite at night. Our room had a window that was looking in another room just a one meter away (I think that is the case for all rooms for only 2 person and bigger rooms have windows ). Because of the close proximity of the building the air was not really moving when we opened the windows so the room was quite damp. The bed was also a bit hard. Don’t expect a hostel vibe. There are no community spaces for socialising with fellow travellers. However these are just small inconveniences , all in all we had a lovely stay and even prolonged it for 2 nights! :)) ####[['the staff was really nice and always ready to help', 'service', 'positive'], ['the accommodation is on a cute quiet street with a lot of street food vendors nearby', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['you can get to more touristy area in 15min by walking', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['i would recommend doing laundry here as well', 'service', 'positive'], ['the room also had a tv that is connected to wi fi so you can watch netflix or you tube', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['it definitely has a hotel vibe not hostel so it’s quite at night', 'experience', 'positive'], ['our room had a window', 'facility', 'positive'], ['because of the close proximity of the building the air was not really moving when we opened the windows so the room was quite damp', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the bed was also a bit hard', 'facility', 'negative'], ['don’t expect a hostel vibe', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['there are no community spaces for socialising with fellow travellers', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we had a lovely stay and even prolonged it for 2 nights', 'experience', 'positive']]

274642,Staff was very accomodating with all of our needs. We stayed here twice w/ a 2 day break in between and they were nice enough to see if we could have the same room for both stays.

274555,I loved my stay at Vy Khanh Guesthouse. The room was very clean and tidy. The guesthouse has a central location and there are great restaurants nearby to try local food. Although it is close to Bui Vien street (also known as a walking party street), the guesthouse is located in a little alley, where the music from the bars can't be heard. The highlight of my stay was Ms Vy, she is an excellent host! Ms Vy accompanied me to the local banh mi festival that was happening during my stay. She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals! She's a lovely person and I enjoyed a lot spending time with her. I truly recommend staying at Vy Khanh Guesthouse! What a lovely day I spent in Ho Chi Minh!

Because of the humidity in the city, the room had a little bit of a funny smell.

There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days.

274480,Location was convenient and staff were really helpful and friendly. We stayed in room 109 which was a family room. The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on. We booked a family room as we were travelling with our teenage son - house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel, towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay. They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room. No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries. Limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels. Very poor for a family room. Breakfast buffet was basic, bar staff were friendly, but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu. ####[['location was convenient', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' staff were really helpful and friendly', 'service', 'positive'], ['the room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on', 'facility', 'negative'], [' house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel, towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay', 'facility', 'negative'], ['they took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones', 'facility', 'negative'], ['i had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels', 'branding', 'negative'], ['the room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room', 'facility', 'negative'], [' no counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries', 'facility', 'negative'], ['limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels', 'facility', 'negative'], ['breakfast buffet was basic', 'service', 'neutral'], ['bar staff were friendly', 'service', 'positive'], ['but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu', 'service', 'negative'], ['very poor for a family room', 'facility', 'negative']]

275654,We had a phenomenal stay at Jaguar House! The place was very nice, the bungalow clean and the staff very friendly. Great and spacious pool with Jacuzzi but also the beach is only a few meters away. Also there are lots of attractions, restaurants, bars and shops just in walking proximity. The hosts also gave us great recommendations about what to do and also hooked us up with the local tours that made our experience flawless. It might get a bit noisy in the evening as there is a little live music venue across the street but we actually enjoyed the acoustic guitar set they played so that was actually a plus for us and anyway they didn't go past 10pm.

Overall a beautiful hotel that needs loads of TLC! The hotel needs a proper clean. I walked in the socks in the room and had to chuck them as they turned black after 5 minutes. The beds didn't have fitted sheets, so would wake up on the mattress (which was also not the cleanest).

They only have four for I think 27 levels and one of them wasn’t working. Sometimes it took ten minutes until an elevator arrived. Breakfast is good but they only serve it from six to nine. And especially from eight to nine it is extremely crowded. The food in the in-room dining menu was only okay. From a five star hotel I expect much better food. What was also really annoying that you can’t charge anything to your room.

274113,- Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay. - Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before. The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :) ####[['tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'service', 'positive'], ['breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before', 'service', 'positive'], ["the best pineapple juice we've ever had", 'service', 'positive'], ['the room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'facility', 'positive'], ['options range from beef pho right through to avocado on toast', 'service', 'positive'], ['the pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at nigh', 'facility', 'positive'], ['laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'service', 'positive'], [' the beach is a minutes walk away', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'experience', 'positive'], [' good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area', 'service', 'positive'], [' to cycle to hoi an old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we would recommend staying in an bang beach and then travelling to hoi an during the day or evening', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'facility', 'negative'], [' if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'experience', 'neutral'], ["it would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware", 'experience', 'neutral'], ['bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell', 'service', 'neutral']]

Our room was very good, with a huge 8ft bed, everything was very clean. The beach was out of this world, wonderful. The hills, to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200/300 yards. We only did it once, never again. The temperature was 30°c plus. The resort has golf buggies which stand idle for much of the day, surely they could be used to ferry guests to the top and down again if necessary. The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling. Taxis are available and not expensive but it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping. ####[['breakfast was excellent, catering for eastern and western tastes', 'service', 'positive'], ['the open sided sunrise room was high up and gave beautiful views of the resort and the beach', 'facility', 'positive'], ['our room was very good, with a huge 8ft bed, everything was very clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the beach was out of this world, wonderful', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the hills, to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200/300 yards', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the temperature was 30°c plus', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' the resort has golf buggies', 'facility', 'positive'], [' the security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling', 'service', 'neutral'], ['taxis are available and not expensive', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping', 'experience', 'negative']]
271158,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience. ####[['the owner, nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay', 'service', 'positive'], ['nam even lent me a traditional vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of bai dinh, but i insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'service', 'positive'], [' bamboo farmstay is conveniently located near the bai dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['i highly recommend visiting this area now', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['the farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['although they normally close at 9 pm, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'service', 'positive'], ['while the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i would definitely choose to stay at bamboo farmstay again if i return to ninh binh in the future', 'loyalty', 'positive'], [' i wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine vietnamese experience', 'loyalty', 'positive']]

This was at the last minute on our way to airport. My partner who has a heart condition had to walk in the hot sun to find an atm.

To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view! Mr. Tung at the reception was very helpful and friendly. ####[['beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony', 'facility', 'positive'], ['superb breakfast buffet', 'service', 'positive'], ['wonderful staff and service', 'service', 'positive'], [' a playroom for the kids with an attendant', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too', 'service', 'positive'], ['the spa was lovely', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' we were very happy with our stay', 'experience', 'positive'], [' we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong', 'experience', 'positive'], [' for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' mr. tung at the reception was very helpful and friendly', 'service', 'positive'], [" this is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids", 'experience', 'neutral'], ['so you have to take an extra bed at an added cost', 'experience', 'neutral'], ["hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view", 'experience', 'neutral']]

275343,Cherry the owner was lovely, she let us check in early as we had just gotten off of a bus at 7am. We had a sleep and then paid later on and she even went to the lengths of cooking us some food as we weren’t feeling very well. - the breakfasts were the best we had in Vietnam, they were very cultural and yummy. The garden was beautiful and relaxing to sit in. - you can book busses and tours through Cherry aswell. We had used the laundry service offered at Cherry Homestay, however a few of our items had gone missing (even though we were the only people staying there at this point, so nothing should have been mixed up?) After asking if I could come with her to the drying area, i immediately saw some more of our laundry hanging up at the front. I asked if Cherry knew where the rest was but I sort of just received a shrug and she left.. so I’m now missing underwear and a few tops.. :( - this was extra disappointing as we had had a lovely time all round. ####[['cherry the owner was lovely, she let us check in early as we had just gotten off of a bus at 7am', 'service', 'positive'], ['we had a sleep and then paid later on and she even went to the lengths of cooking us some food as we weren’t feeling very well', 'service', 'positive'], ['the breakfasts were the best we had in vietnam, they were very cultural and yummy', 'service', 'positive'], ['the garden was beautiful and relaxing to sit in', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you can book busses and tours through cherry aswell', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we had used the laundry service offered at cherry homestay', 'service', 'positive'], ['this was extra disappointing as we had had a lovely time all round', 'experience', 'negative'], ['a few of our items had gone missing', 'experience', 'negative'], ['after asking if i could come with her to the drying area, i immediately saw some more of our laundry hanging up at the front', 'experience', 'negative'], ['i asked if cherry knew where the rest was but i sort of just received a shrug and she left', 'experience', 'negative']]

275379,Very good location; albeit being placed on a busy street, it was calm enough. The bed was very comfortable, and there was enough storage space in the room. There is a good basement for motorbike parking. Cheap shuttle (taxi) to the airport - half the price of Grab offer. Upon our arrival, the receptionist just gave us the key without any information about the hotel (how to get to our room, what activities it offers etc.). In the room, there were writings on the wall, perhaps made by some kids in the past, the toilet seat was loose, the mirror cabinet was broken. There was a lot of dust behind and under the bed. The water temperature in the shower was always random, no matter what position one puts the handle to. In the mornings (usually after 7. 30 am), there were construction sounds heard from beyond the wall - there was no way to sleep through it. Based on my experience in Asia, 10k VND for a small bottle of water (especially in a nice hotel) is just ridiculous; usually it's free. ####[['very good location', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['albeit being placed on a busy street, it was calm enough', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ['the bed was very comfortable, and there was enough storage space in the room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there is a good basement for motorbike parking', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['cheap shuttle (taxi) to the airport - half the price of grab offer', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the receptionist just gave us the key without any information about the hotel', 'service', 'negative'], ['in the room, there were writings on the wall', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the toilet seat was loose, the mirror cabinet was broken', 'facility', 'negative'], ['there was a lot of dust behind and under the bed', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the water temperature in the shower was always random', 'facility', 'negative'], ['there were construction sounds heard from beyond the wall - there was no way to sleep through it', 'experience', 'negative'], ['10k vnd for a small bottle of water (especially in a nice hotel) is just ridiculous', 'service', 'negative']]

271192,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking.

275946,The location of the property was amazing. The room was nice and the bathroom as well. The breakfast had a wide range of options and was delicious. The staff only cared to inform us the pool, rooftop bar, and other facilities such as jacuzzi and sauna were closed due to maintenance after we paid for the room. We specifically chose this hotel for its facilities as the weather in Ho Chi Minh can be very hot. So, they should have informed us before we paid. They did offer another pool at Cochin Sang Hotel, which was 5 min away by foot. However, it was more like a bubble bath instead of a pool, and the inconvenience of having to walk to another hotel wasn’t worth it. Another thing worth mentioning is that we gave them our laundry. When we received it back, our socks were bleached and grew 2x in size. This meant that they were ruined and couldn’t be worn anymore. We did come to an agreement, in which the cost of the laundry was free and the taxi to the airport paid by the hotel, however, it did come with a lot of inconvenience as me and my partner were travelling more after Ho Chi Minh. ####[['the location of the property was amazing', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the room was nice and the bathroom as well', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the breakfast had a wide range of options and was delicious', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff only cared to inform us the pool, rooftop bar, and other facilities such as jacuzzi and sauna were closed due to maintenance after we paid for the room', 'service', 'negative'], ['we specifically chose this hotel for its facilities', 'experience', 'negative'], ['they should have informed us before we paid', 'experience', 'negative'], ['it was more like a bubble bath instead of a pool, and the inconvenience of having to walk to another hotel wasn’t worth it', 'experience', 'negative'], ['when we received it back, our socks were bleached and grew 2x in size', 'service', 'positive'], ['this meant that they were ruined and couldn’t be worn anymore', 'experience', 'negative'], ['we did come to an agreement, in which the cost of the laundry was free and the taxi to the airport paid by the hotel', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it did come with a lot of inconvenience as me and my partner were travelling more after ho chi minh', 'experience', 'negative']]

There were many problems with the room. Firstly there are no external windows, only a window into the corridor. This was constantly lit through poor curtains meaning the room was never dark. There was no separation between the bar/music and our room, I could make out conversations whilst trying to sleep. The pool plant room was just outside the ‘window’, this was quite noisy. Most annoyingly was the loud hammering that lasted about 5 mins every morning at 7am. You could set your clock by it. We thought this was some in-house maintenance but it woke us every time.

273018,The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building. It's in Da Nang, and the staff are pretty nice! The shower is big and the water pressure is good. Decent place to work as well, because of the good Wi Fi. The price was amazing. Really incredibly cheap for what you get. The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours. Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable. I can't hold anything against the staff, but my experience here was dreadful. I'm sorry. But I do hope my feedback goes somewhere, since there are positive aspects to the hotel too. ####[[' the staff are pretty nice', 'service', 'positive'], ['the shower is big and the water pressure is good', 'facility', 'positive'], ['decent place to work as well, because of the good wi fi', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the hotel itself is quite a nice looking building', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the price was amazing', 'experience', 'positive'], ['really incredibly cheap for what you get', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed', 'facility', 'negative'], [' the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area', 'experience', 'negative'], ['overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable', 'experience', 'negative'], ['my experience here was dreadful', 'experience', 'negative'], ["i can't hold anything against the staff", 'service', 'neutral'], ['since there are positive aspects to the hotel too', 'branding', 'positive'], ["i'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours", 'experience', 'negative']]

She offered me really bad exchange rate (quite worse then the one I got at Intecontinental a day before) and once more confirmed I can not exchange it outside. After that (lie) i went out and after 1min walk saw that there are many touristic small agencies where you can exchange money with quite better rate.

274450,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English.

272386,Good location, good happy hours and comfy beds. This hotel claims to be the first 5* in Hanoi and even though the price tag is there, I don’t think the hotel is yet. The hotel itself is beautiful, especially the main lobby area but our room was very underwhelming. We stayed in room 301 which was between some sort of staff room and the staff only elevator so there was a lot of noise from 7am onwards. There was also a lot of maintenance work going on on Monday 10/04 which had us up very early (sounded like drilling). Our toilet and shower cubicles both had mould around the floor tiles too! We used the facilities on the roof top, both the pool and the bar and these weren’t at a 5* standard either. The pool is really small and there are only 8 loungers which are super close together. Despite them being full, no staff offered us the lounge cushions which I found inside near the sauna but they were very quick and pushy about us ordering drinks whilst we were using the facilities. The bar has a good happy hour but it was a good 15/20 minute wait per drink. The drinks themselves were excellent though and they make a top notch Negroni! I think they need to make a couple of tweaks to get this place up to standard and it definitely could be there with some changes but as it currently is, there are more affordable and equally nice hotels around the old town. ####[['this hotel claims to be the first 5* in hanoi and even though the price tag is there, i don’t think the hotel is yet', 'branding', 'neutral'], ['the hotel itself is beautiful, especially the main lobby area', 'facility', 'positive'], ['but our room was very underwhelming. we stayed in room 301 which was between some sort of staff room and the staff only elevator so there was a lot of noise from 7am onwards', 'facility', 'negative'], ['there was also a lot of maintenance work going on on monday 10/04 which had us up very early', 'experience', 'negative'], ['our toilet and shower cubicles both had mould around the floor tiles too', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we used the facilities on the roof top, both the pool and the bar and these weren’t at a 5* standard either', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the pool is really small and there are only 8 loungers which are super close together', 'facility', 'negative'], ['despite them being full, no staff offered us the lounge cushions which i found inside near the sauna but they were very quick and pushy about us ordering drinks whilst we were using the facilities', 'service', 'negative'], ['the bar has a good happy hour but it was a good 15/20 minute wait per drink', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the drinks themselves were excellent though and they make a top notch negroni', 'service', 'positive'], ['there are more affordable and equally nice hotels around the old town', 'branding', 'negative']]

275998,Good hotel,lovely rooftop area and small but refreshing pool. The location is perfect with everything at your door. Not a criticism but an observation. The staff strive for excellence and deliver. We are very lucky coming from a wealthy country to be able to afford a hotel in this category and pay the rate it asks,something not so available to most Vietnamese. In their pursuit of excellence i felt the staff were required to show a sense of deference. I felt slightly uncomfortable when they rushed to open the hotel door if they hadnt noticed me coming in or out,i felt slightly uncomfortable being referred to as 'Sir' all the time--I prefer more a more casual,,relaxed service from staff. I am not a superior being,i'm no better than the staff that work here,but i felt like i was treated as one- Management want excellence and thats the standard they expect delivered..I'm just not a big fan of it. I prefer a more casual,relaxed,service. I want to see the staffs personality,humour,warmth,relaxed conviviality, not just their trained efficiency. --Yep,maybe it's just me. Though the breakfast was fine,it wasnt as extensive as other hotels we stayed at-i think the hotel can do better than the washed out juices it offered. ####[['good hotel', 'facility', 'positive'], ['lovely rooftop area and small', 'facility', 'positive'], ['refreshing pool', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the location is perfect with everything at your door', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the staff strive for excellence and deliver', 'service', 'positive'], ['in their pursuit of excellence i felt the staff were required to show a sense of deference', 'service', 'negative'], ['i felt slightly uncomfortable when they rushed to open the hotel door if they hadnt noticed me coming in or out', 'service', 'negative'], ["i felt slightly uncomfortable being referred to as 'sir' all the time", 'service', 'negative'], ['i prefer more a more casual,,relaxed service from staff', 'service', 'negative'], ['i prefer a more casual,relaxed,service.', 'service', 'neutral'], ['i want to see the staffs personality,humour,warmth,relaxed conviviality, not just their trained efficiency', 'service', 'neutral'], ['breakfast was fine', 'service', 'positive'], ['it wasnt as extensive as other hotels we stayed at', 'service', 'negative'], ['i think the hotel can do better than the washed out juices it offered', 'service', 'negative']]

274053,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet.

270850,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside. ####[['the accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there were ample electrical socketss', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there was plenty of parking near the gate', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'branding', 'negative'], ['the restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'facility', 'positive'], [' there were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, napoli being the best', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'facility', 'positive'], [' there was only a buffet breakfast on the sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'facility', 'negative'], ['at other times there was a limited menu', 'service', 'negative'], ["there wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside", 'facility', 'negative']]

Breakfast was homemade, traditional vietnamese and tasty! They have a cute dog and two cats. I am allergic to cats but had no problems at all because the whole house was very clean. Also, you have to do the vegan cooking class and meditation with Lisa and Yong (one of our favorite memories), available on air bnb.

273407,Well worth the price! Convenient location right by the airport. Premium looking finishes in the interior of the room and the hotel in general. Clean and fresh sheets everyday care of the excellent housekeeping. Great pool area and good view of the sunset from higher levels. Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL, in addition to the good level of english they have. They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away.

It has lots of hangers which was very useful for our winter jackets. They also had Netflix on the TV right in front of the bed, which made this place felt more homey. The elevator was small but worked just fine. I've read some reviews that you need to go up through small stairs, but that happened if your property is at 11th floor above. Ours was in 10th so it was fine. The host was very communicative and supportive during our stay. p. s. They also had motorbike rent, but manual only. The bed was a bit thinner that usual bed, so it was not as comfy as your common hotel bed, but we slept just fine. The blanket was very comfortable though so it helped. The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos, but it was fine. There's no good food around the place and it was about 10 mins by motorbike from Old Quarter. So, you have to rent motorbike if you wanna go to the nearest popular spots.

271016,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else. The boat was full when we went and most of the other guests were quiet loud Vietnamese on holiday (it may differ at other times of the year). Personally, we don’t like timetables / schedules so didn’t warm to the frequent announcements but we did get all the activities we were promised. We didn’t get the “welcome drinks” mentioned in the original information but a minor thing. ####[['everything run on time', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay', 'service', 'positive'], ['we had arranged transfers with la regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go', 'service', 'positive'], ['the room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning ', 'facility', 'positive'], ['lovely bed and private balcony', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we didn’t get the “welcome drinks” mentioned in the original information', 'branding', 'negative']]

The tea set that they provided in the room was exceptional – it came with loose leaf tea, a kettle with a built-in sieve and two beautiful ceramic cups.

271898,Facilities are quite new and beautiful. Staffs are so nice and friendly and bring up good service. Checkin time and go out/return time is flexible. There is also motorbike rental service. Firstly, I booked 4 sea view room but we can't see any piece of sea here. I asked one staff about it but the answer is just let me check. I wouldn't be upset if it didn't claimed as 'beachfront' and 'sea view'.Secondly, the soundproofing system is very poor. I can hear everything from the next room and the hall's conversations. Thirdly, the hotel claimed itself as 4-star service but the service is quite more like 3-star. Shampoo and shower gel are outdated. And the hotel also claimed as beachfront but it wasn't. More like 500m from the beach. You can see its location on Google Maps. And the lacking of some important stuffs here, for example it doesn't have "Do not disturb" sign outside the room door. The cleaning staff knocked on my door in the morning and disturbed my sleep. I'm not sure if the water is clean but 3/8 persons in my group got itchy after shower. ####[['facilities are quite new and beautiful', 'facility', 'positive'], ['staffs are so nice and friendly and bring up good service', 'service', 'positive'], ['checkin time and go out/return time is flexible', 'service', 'positive'], ['there is also motorbike rental service', 'amenity', 'positive'], ["the soundproofing system is very poor. i can hear everything from the next room and the hall's conversations", 'facility', 'negative'], ['the hotel claimed itself as 4-star service but the service is quite more like 3-star', 'branding', 'negative'], ['shampoo and shower gel are outdated', 'service', 'negative'], ["the hotel also claimed as beachfront but it wasn't.", 'branding', 'negative'], ['more like 500m from the beach', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['the lacking of some important stuffs here', 'service', 'negative'], ['the cleaning staff knocked on my door in the morning and disturbed my sleep', 'service', 'negative'], ["i'm not sure if the water is clean but 3/8 persons in my group got itchy after shower", 'facility', 'negative']]

She is an incredibly sweet hard worker and I would come visit again to see her again. The pool was also fantastic, the breakfast tasty, the chair hammocks very comfortable. The twin bunk room was great because I ended up befriending the other guest and we got along great. The bed was comfy and entire stay was WELL worth the money and very clean and comfortable. After a large rainstorm we did see an insect scurry in, but it was quickly and easily handled.

273485,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience.

270085,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything.

276550,Its been an outstanding experience indeed one of a kind. It's been 2 years that I am planning on visiting a farm in my next visit to Vietnam, I really wanted to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the Saigon, and here I am in a magical place, surrounded by beautiful rice fields. The farm is simple and yet very special, one can tell that it was built with love and respect to nature but also for the best traveler experience. If that's not enough, the host was super welcoming, it felt safe, warm, and yet very much private when I wanted to have my space. The room is made of bamboo and natural materials and was spacious and functional. About 10 drive from the farm there is a national park on the Mekong River, the host gave me a ride there and arranged 90 minutes boat ride, this site was also great, nice river and lots of Birds and some Buffalo on the river bank, seeing the sunset on the background of the vast land of the Mekong was beautiful. I am the kind of person that wants to know what he eats, and during this visit I was amazed by the creativity of the Vietnamese cuisine, the host invited me to choose herbs and flowers from the farm’s garden and then cooked delicious local dishes with them accompanied by beef, chicken, and seafood, it was really cool experience that made the lunch and dinner a rewarding experience, I guess there is something about eating what you picked up 2 ago… In terms of accessibility, the host was accommodating as well, guide me where to buy the bus tickets from Ho Chi Minh City, picked me up with his motorcycle from the local bus station, and took me over to the farm which was around 5 minutes drive. If you are curious about the authentic countryside this is the right place if you are well-traveled, and I am, then I am quite certain that you’re after some new memorable experiences. Look no further :) I will be back again, no doubt about that. The mattress, it's not a huge issue but I would recommend having it a bit more thicker. ####[['its been an outstanding experience indeed one of a kind', 'experience', 'positive'], ['i am in a magical place, surrounded by beautiful rice fields', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the host was super welcoming', 'service', 'positive'], ['it felt safe, warm, and yet very much private when i wanted to have my space', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the room is made of bamboo and natural materials and was spacious and functional', 'facility', 'positive'], ['this site was also great, nice river', 'experience', 'positive'], ['seeing the sunset on the background of the vast land of the mekong was beautiful', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the host invited me to choose herbs and flowers from the farm’s garden and then cooked delicious local dishes with them accompanied by beef, chicken, and seafood, it was really cool experience that made the lunch and dinner a rewarding experience', 'experience', 'positive'], ['in terms of accessibility, the host was accommodating as well, guide me where to buy the bus tickets from ho chi minh city', 'service', 'positive'], ['picked me up with his motorcycle from the local bus station', 'service', 'positive'], ['took me over to the farm which was around 5 minutes drive', 'service', 'positive'], ['if you are curious about the authentic countryside this is the right place if you are well-traveled', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['i will be back again, no doubt about that', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ["the mattress, it's not a huge issue but i would recommend having it a bit more thicker", 'facility', 'neutral'], ['the host gave me a ride there and arranged 90 minutes boat ride', 'service', 'positive']]

274088,The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything. The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside. This really isn't a problem! All staff were fantastic. There are so many trips and variations on offer and so it was difficult to know what was best for the budget. We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed! We would recommend the Met restaurant close to the hotel. ####[['the location in the old quarter was fantastic and close to everything', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['all staff were fantastic', 'service', 'positive'], ["we listened to mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted", 'service', 'positive'], [' everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back', 'service', 'positive']]

They should have the kids indoor play area where kids can spend their time while staying in resorts. This is one of the biggest drawback in this property 3.

270823,From the moment I set foot in the door the staff were amazing from start to finish. Tommy (Manh) looked after me like I was part of his family. I ended up getting scammed by a cab driver as it was my first trip to Hanoi and I didn't know any better. 1 call to Tommy and he came straight over to sort it out! He calls you cabs, rents you bikes, changes money cheaply and get you sim cards. Its a hotel but also a one stop for all your needs becuase they really care about you having the best time possible. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience there with them. I had a balcony room, it was very clean, serviced each day I was there and everything worked as I should have. If you are looking to rent a place in the heart of old quarter, which is within walking distance of a lot of things to do, then this is definitely the place to go!

The early morning water market trip on Taun's boat was followed up with a tour of the incredible land market. The Mekong is truly a paradise of exotic fruit, vegetables and fish and the land market shows these off. The guests select the ingredients for the evening meal which is prepared by Tuan's family. An absolute feast!Best of all is Tuan's hospitality. He makes sure that all is organized for a perfect stay including transportation to and from the airport/bus station, boat trip, local tour and delicious meals (3 a day for a nominal cost). He does this with warmth and humor. It was also a treat to socialize with the other guests. We had a fabulous time at Boutique Lodge with wonderful memories to treasure.

The family who own the homestay made us a tasty breakfast that was different each day, including a hot coffee and endless tea, as well as some fruit. The place has a really lovely welcoming vibe that makes you feel immediately at home, despite the owners having no English and having to use Google translate to communicate. They are very patient and willing to assist with anything. Our stay also included laundry that was returned to us within 24 hours and a very reasonably priced motorbike rental.!

I even told her how I was on a tight budget and she managed to sort out ways to make it cheaper. The room was exactly as expected online. It was clean and comfy, having being well decorated. Furthermore, it was central, has an atm next door and a lovely lobby (where I was even offered an ice cream).

274477,Very friendly staff in a incredibly located hotel in the heart of the Old Quarter. Breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering. The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market which means on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy. The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues. Note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view but unfortunately the room was like a goldfish bowl with windows all around and curtains that didn't cover the windows well meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market. ####[['very friendly staff in a incredibly', 'service', 'positive'], [' located hotel in the heart of the old quarter', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering', 'service', 'positive'], ['the location despite being great is right at the end of the night market', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' on a friday night it is incredibly noisy.', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, we were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' worth considering if you have mobility issues', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view', 'experience', 'positive'], [" windows all around and curtains that didn't cover the windows well", 'facility', 'negative'], ['meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market', 'experience', 'negative']]

The second day we did a boat tour and she directly asked for driving us to this place. Same the last day she drove us to the bus station and gave us some water because it was very hot. She offers us more than expected, we felt like being special guest! If you have questions for renting motorbikes, booking a bus she'll be there for you in a very kind way.

The hotel has bikes available that you can use whenever you want to go into town (15-20 min ride ) or you can rent a motorcycle if you have the license.

270452,I stayed in the Riverside villa during our trip to Hoi An and must say that this was one of the best decisions. The villa is beautifully located surrounded by River on one side and open views. Easy connectivity to main roads, the Hoi An Old village area and all other attractions are just a 15 min. Don't want to walk the villa will provide cycles free of cost. They can also arrange scooters for you to roam around the Hoi An.

Once home we asked each other which was our favourite place we stayed in the 18 days from Saigon to Hanoi and everything in-between. We all agreed Hoi An Odyssey was the classiest, cleanest, friendliest, best located hotel we stayed at. Just outside the town, and easily walkable with a perfect pool and lovely food, our room was beyond beautiful and again, the staff were the absolute icing on the cake.

It was nice to have breakfast in the room. You can choose to have brekkie by the pool, in the lobby area or in your room. They even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast. Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself. Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock, which makes the area quite unique. The spa upstairs is great, the massage therapists are very good, and one spa treatment is included in the room price. With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town. Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall. Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention.

274511,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option. ####[['the room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice ', 'facility', 'positive'], [' it was nice being near the beach and grab taxi’s are available to get into town', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the cleaning staff were very friendly', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'service', 'negative'], ['the pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'experience', 'negative'], ['1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well', 'experience', 'negative'], ['on our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'service', 'negative'], [' the laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'service', 'negative'], ['the food and drink is also very overpriced', 'service', 'negative'], ['and very average', 'service', 'negative'], ['there is no local advice available from the staff', 'service', 'negative'], ['we weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'service', 'negative'], ['the breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use', 'service', 'negative'], ['most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'facility', 'negative'], ['this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option', 'experience', 'neutral']]

I loved the view from the room- of the sun coming up from behind the mountain and shining on the lake, filling the room with sunlight. Hai - the host is quite a barista and brews very good Italian coffee. The family dog Gung - is very friendly and welcoming. The hosts were very welcoming and generous - even offering to help with our laundry. I would without a doubt recommend this place to stay.

The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter.

273994,We did an extensive review (in person as well) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one. The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention. I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better. ####[['the design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling', 'facility', 'positive'], [' the views are absolutely gorgeous', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooms are big and comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['when there is heavy rain there can be water leakage.', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself', 'facility', 'negative'], [' some staff is nice', 'service', 'positive'], ['almost none speak english well and they can be perceived as rude', 'service', 'negative'], [' i think the language barrier is the biggest problem', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['i would suggest the management trains the people a bit better', 'service', 'neutral'], [' all the hotels in the area and i would say this one is the best one', 'branding', 'positive']]

Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap.

So nice to plug into Netflix for a few minutes while you're waiting for the wife and daughter to finish up in the bathroom! :-). The breakfast was very good for the price and having free bikes to pedal around on was fun. My daughter fell in love with the owner's dogs - I just wanted to eat them (kidding!). Hue is an incredible city that we should have spent more than 36 hours in...don't make the mistake we made - make the Le Robinet a few days stay!

276124,It was our first trip to Hanoi. I booked the hotel after reading a lot of reviews about the hotel. To be honest, it exceeded my expectations. It was a fantastic experience for us. Very courteous and polite staff each time we reached out to them to gather some information. Staff were really the standout!! Breakfast was very decent. Eggs could be ordered, the menu changes each day with some items like bread, croissant, danish were the same throughout. When our daughter was sick, they also allowed to carry the breakfast to the room. The restaurant staff packed us breakfast for our daughter. Hotel is located at a place where it is walking distance, most of the old quarter areas and some beyond could be covered by walking. It's quite chaotic to walk in the narrow streets where traffic is both ways but it was very much fun. Coming from India, it was not very different to the experience in India. We booked the tour guide via the hotel and it was very good. The hotel staff advised us clearly about the charges, gave recommendations to what sort of tour we must go for based on the time we had. Overall it was a very satisfying holiday. One of the restaurant staff didn't bother to check if a salad was pure vegetarian before advising us. The salad contained ham, and we were pure vegetarians. We felt that the staff could have checked before just saying that it was vegetarian. ####[['to be honest, it exceeded my expectations', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it was a fantastic experience for us', 'experience', 'positive'], ['very courteous and polite staff each time we reached out to them to gather some information', 'service', 'positive'], ['staff were really the standout', 'service', 'positive'], ['breakfast was very decent. eggs could be ordered, the menu changes each day with some items like bread, croissant, danish were the same throughout', 'service', 'positive'], ['when our daughter was sick, they also allowed to carry the breakfast to the room', 'service', 'positive'], ['the restaurant staff packed us breakfast for our daughter', 'service', 'positive'], ['hotel is located at a place where it is walking distance, most of the old quarter areas and some beyond could be covered by walking', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' the hotel staff advised us clearly about the charges, gave recommendations to what sort of tour we must go for based on the time we had', 'service', 'positive'], ['it was a very satisfying holiday', 'experience', 'positive'], ["one of the restaurant staff didn't bother to check if a salad was pure vegetarian before advising us", 'service', 'negative'], ['the salad contained ham, and we were pure vegetarians', 'service', 'negative'], ['we felt that the staff could have checked before just saying that it was vegetarian', 'service', 'negative']]

270574,The pool was a god send as we had moved from another hotel in the city as it did not have a pool. Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone.

But the highlight was the service. I travel a lot both privately and through work, and I can honestly say that the amicable and flexible service of San and his colleague's was at the same level as Asian luxury boutique hotels at 20x the cost. They helped me out with everything I needed, always with a smile, and I felt completely taken care of whether I needed help with my luggage, transportation, local advice or booking trips.

We thoroughly enjoyed a menu of chicken stir-fry, shrimp stir-fry and spring rolls at the property. Much better quality than the dinner we had in Sapa. But the gem is the gardens surrounding the property, they are absolutely stunning. There are several sitting areas to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening.

270385,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun. ####[['the pool was nice', 'facility', 'positive'], [' the location (close to the night market) was also good', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['i would really not recommend this hotel', 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['the room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm', 'facility', 'negative'], [' the water pressure was almost non existent.', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the airconditioning did not work most of the time', 'facility', 'negative'], ['most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible', 'service', 'negative'], ['the staff did not speak a word of english. we had to communicate via google translate', 'service', 'negative'], ['this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in vietnam', 'branding', 'negative']]

The way to get there is an off-road adventure as local authorities stopped the onsite hotels to get a proper tarmacroad. In rainy season almost unreachable for a usual cab. (Although for us it was great fun with two scooters and five persons.) The food was ok, we rather went elsewhere around, which is quiet a ride. The immense infrastructure projects all around the island will hopefully stop, before there is only overtourism existing.

272606,Our stay at Hanoi Media Hotel and Spa made our trip to Hanoi perfect. The location of the hotel in the Old Quarter is fantastic if you want to be near Hoan Kiem Lake. We were literally 2 minutes walk from the Huc Bridge. We made full use of the amazing location and spent many hours happily exploring the Old Quarter. The team at Hanoi Media did an amazing job looking after us. We arrived in the city via train in the early hours of the morning and went directly to the hotel. I had let them know about our early arrival and they had said if they couldn't accommodate an early check in for us, they would keep our luggage for us until our rooms were ready. As soon as we arrived they prepared a free room for us, at a minimal charge, which we could use for the next 6 hours to freshen up and rest while we waited for our booked rooms to be vacated and cleaned for us. In addition, when checking out, they made one of our rooms available for a late check out, so we could pack and leave the hotel as late as possible. This willingness to ensure our comfort and convenience was maintained throughout our stay and was hugely appreciated by us. They also stored and kept our luggage for us when we checked out to spend 2 nights at Ha Long Bay. Our rooms were great. We booked the Junior Suite with Terrace, and when returning from Ha Long Bay, stayed in the Junior Suite with Balcony. Both rooms were lovely. The Junior Suite with Terrace is an extremely large room with lovely space to move around, and we loved the Junior Suite with Balcony for its fantastic views over the city where we could sit and admire the city lights and sounds. Our second room was the Superior Double Room which served perfectly for our teenage daughters. This was a quiet, safe space where they could sleep in and relax when taking some time off from exploring the city. We enjoyed the Lux Skybar, and the kind doormen at the entrance to the hotel. Always on hand with a smile and warm greeting. While the location is ideal for being a part of the Old Quarter, it is worth it to know that on weekends the area around Hoan Kiem Lake is extremely busy and loud with music. Thankfully the hotel accommodates this very well and we could close the sliding doors of our rooms and were not disturbed by the city noise and music at all. ####[['our stay at hanoi media hotel and spa made our trip to hanoi perfect', 'service', 'positive'], ['the location of the hotel in the old quarter is fantastic if you want to be near hoan kiem lake', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we were literally 2 minutes walk from the huc bridge', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we made full use of the amazing location and spent many hours happily exploring the old quarter', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the team at hanoi media did an amazing job looking after us', 'service', 'positive'], ["i had let them know about our early arrival and they had said if they couldn't accommodate an early check in for us, they would keep our luggage for us until our rooms were ready", 'service', 'positive'], ['as soon as we arrived they prepared a free room for us, at a minimal charge, which we could use for the next 6 hours to freshen up and rest while we waited for our booked rooms to be vacated and cleaned for us', 'service', 'positive'], ['when checking out, they made one of our rooms available for a late check out, so we could pack and leave the hotel as late as possible', 'service', 'positive'], ['this willingness to ensure our comfort and convenience was maintained throughout our stay and was hugely appreciated by us', 'service', 'positive'], ['they also stored and kept our luggage for us when we checked out to spend 2 nights at ha long bay', 'service', 'positive'], ['our rooms were great. we booked the junior suite with terrace, and when returning from ha long bay, stayed in the junior suite with balcony. both rooms were lovely', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the junior suite with terrace is an extremely large room with lovely space to move around, and we loved the junior suite with balcony for its fantastic views over the city where we could sit and admire the city lights and sounds', 'facility', 'positive'], ['our second room was the superior double room which served perfectly for our teenage daughters', 'facility', 'positive'], ['this was a quiet, safe space where they could sleep in and relax when taking some time off from exploring the city', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we enjoyed the lux skybar, and the kind doormen at the entrance to the hotel', 'facility', 'positive'], ['always on hand with a smile and warm greeting', 'service', 'positive'], ['thankfully the hotel accommodates this very well and we could close the sliding doors of our rooms and were not disturbed by the city noise and music at all', 'experience', 'positive']]

276341,We had the time of our lives in the Orchid Trendy Cruise 01! What a wonderful experience - from reservation to the end, it was all so smooth. The team is extremely helpful and they really deliver a 5* service. We were very impressed with the logistics of the service. Thank you Hannah for organising our reservation and transfer to and from the cruise - especially the return one to the airport! It was also so kind of our driver to call us in the morning to confirm the exact time we would be collected. Now, the cruise… wow, what an experience! My only regret was that we only booked it for one night! Needless to say that the Ha Long Bay is stunning, but being able to see it while in the cruise is a dream. The facilities are wonderful and the activities are great. The bedroom views are breathtaking. And the staff… oh wow the staff! The most wonderful people we have encountered in Vietnam - a huge shout out to Harry and Gin! They are both so lovely and friendly and really make you feel welcome. We are celebrating our honeymoon and the staff made sure it was even more special with surprises and lovely celebrations! Thank you everyone, can’t wait to be back!

The property also claimed to have air conditioning, but only one of the bedrooms had an air conditioning unit leaving the other bedroom very hot. Overall very unclean inside.

271671,Staff were friendly, helpful, polite. We ended up booking Hà Long Bay tour, Sapa trekking tour, and Nimh Binh with them for the convenience and price. Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things. Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here! Thank you to the amazing staff! ####[['staff were friendly, helpful, polite', 'service', 'positive'], ['good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things', 'service', 'positive'], ['the location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around hanoi', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['they were great with communication and super accommodating', 'service', 'positive'], ['highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ["hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed", 'service', 'negative'], ['they were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point', 'service', 'neutral'], ['the room is nice ', 'facility', 'positive'], [' i would come back to stay here', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['thank you to the amazing staff', 'service', 'positive']]

She told us all about her and her husbands (who was also amazing but spoke little English) struggle to start a hostel in their city.

Very happily surprised by the equipment quality. The swimming pool is the most relaxing and beautiful place you can imagine. Really made the difference after hot days. Free bicycle,, fresh fruits at breakfast everyday, drinks when you need , impeccable service. Location was exactly what we wanted, close to a local traditional food market/ neighborhood and to paddy fields but also 10mn drive from the hot town. But the best part was Binh, his wife and the whole family. They are truly wonderful hosts, their sense of welcoming is amazing, they are at the same time helpful, discrete, warm , fun and always present when needed. They really welcomed us like family and in a very genuine& sincere way that really made the difference. They have good tips for visiting Hoi An but don't pressure anything which differs from the mood in the center. They truly love what they do, and share this with the guests.

The recommendations from the host. The lady at the front is a nosy and pushy to sell you services. Everytime you walk in or out of the hotel she wants to know what you are up to, where you went and gives you 'advise' if you want it or not. When you get back, she checks if you followed her advice ....Her recommendations are not always the best options in town! (We know commissions are in for the hotel, but it was to obvious and pushing)As an example: when we went to the fabric market, and first wanted to look around (we already did our homework) Within 1 minute a lady from the 'recommended' tailor started following us around, and telling us she knew we where staying in Rock Mouse Villa and making it impossible to talk to any other tailor. We decided to have one item made as a test for the experience (not good: pushing to sell and don't give a damn how the finished garment looks on you). As soon as we got back to the hotel, the hotel lady double checked with us if we had indeed only ordered one item (she already knew) at her recommended shop (commission). Don't get me wrong they do this with a friendly smile and the hotel is perfectly fine.

269977,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool?

272029,Mekong Rustic is a hidden gem. Great location at the end of a lovely orchard and close to town and beautiful scenery for bike trips. Excellent breakfast is included and great food can be ordered for lunch and dinner. Upon arrival you will be picked up for a lovely little boat trip to your large and clean room with views of a beautiful garden from your private terrace. But best of all was Long, who went out of his way to make our stay unforgettable, and who took us on a fantastic boat trip to the floating market and a bicycle tour of the lush farming country near the property.

271055,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences. However, it became an opportunity to appreciate the sacred connection the lodge has with nature and the mountains. The spiritual awakening we experienced through this sacred encounter. ####[['our experience at zizi homestay in sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the hmong community', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek', 'experience', 'positive'], ['while our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences', 'experience', 'positive']]

I found the booking process very irritating, I received several Whats App calls and texts in the days before the cruise from the sales consultant Hang Nga telling me she had a big problem because she had double booked my room, she wanted me to spend one night in a cheaper room then move to my original booked room for the second night. I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it. I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise. Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise. The 2nd day outing wasn't very interesting.

274995,We stayed 3 days and 2 nights. The couple and the staff is really friendly. We asked for vegetarian dinners, which is not common, and the lady cooked several delicious things. We weren't pressured at all to spend more than we wanted (on drinks or meals).The family room we got was comfortable and clean. The room was equipped with 2 fans working well. The view on the rice terrasses from the balcony is beautiful. You may encounter insects or spiders in the bathroom or the room but much much fewer than in another place (HSP L) where we slept a previous night, thanks to the construction style of the buildings. The swimming pool is really appreciated by the customers... But also by friends or acquaintances of the homestay family. So be prepared to get some animation (with loud music) on some afternoons. Like all hotels in the area, be aware that it is isolated, so you're a captive customer because they aren't real restaurants in the area and you need to be an experienced motocycler to travel around. Still you can get great views on rice terrasses with reasonable walking distance but the most beautiful part is probably up North, closer to Vinh Quang, Hoang Su Phi town centre. ####[['the couple and the staff is really friendly', 'service', 'positive'], ['we asked for vegetarian dinners, which is not common, and the lady cooked several delicious things', 'service', 'positive'], ['the family room we got was comfortable and clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the room was equipped with 2 fans working well', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the view on the rice terrasses from the balcony is beautiful', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you may encounter insects or spiders in the bathroom or the room', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the swimming pool is really appreciated by the customers', 'facility', 'positive'], ["you're a captive customer", 'experience', 'negative'], ["they aren't real restaurants in the area", 'service', 'negative'], ['you need to be an experienced motocycler to travel around', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['still you can get great views on rice terrasses with reasonable walking distance', 'experience', 'positive']]

274238,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas. ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'experience', 'positive'], [' rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'facility', 'positive'], ["we're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great", 'experience', 'positive'], [' some rooms have a small sofa', 'facility', 'positive'], [' wi-fi worked great', 'facility', 'positive'], ['toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached', 'facility', 'positive'], ['staff are great', 'service', 'positive'], ['this place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. especially thuy and ms. kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable', 'service', 'positive'], ['they often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away', 'service', 'positive'], ['there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10am', 'service', 'positive'], ['ours was included in the room rates', 'service', 'positive'], ['there was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items', 'service', 'positive'], ['some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints', 'service', 'positive'], ['you could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked', 'service', 'positive'], [' it was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there was a medium sized pool outside', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it is located right on a semi-busy street', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['but we never heard noise from our rooms', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it is set back a bit from the road', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' it is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['we stayed at golden holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms', 'experience', 'neutral']]

I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line.

274401,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy. ####[['this resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'facility', 'positive'], [" the staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them", 'service', 'positive'], [' the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'facility', 'positive'], [" it's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday", 'experience', 'positive'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'service', 'neutral'], [' the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the resort itself is extensive', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of koi carps', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there are plenty of beds around that pool', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the restaurant is good', 'service', 'positive'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'experience', 'positive'], [' you can have drinks there', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'facility', 'positive'], ["the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'experience', 'positive'], [' it is used by the vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy', 'experience', 'neutral']]

There were a couple of things missing in the room, but as soon as you call the reception they solve it in a couple of minutes. Staff at the reception was so helpful. They kindly helped me to book a bus ticket, get a taxi and find a place to get banh mi. Thank you very much. Swimming pool area is great and wasn’t crowded during my stay. I wasn’t very impressed with the breakfast quality. Was definitely expecting more from a place with this reputation. The variety was good, but the quality not as good.

270130,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand. All in all, our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey. ####[[' we spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand', 'service', 'positive'], ['it surpass our expectations', 'experience', 'positive'], ['tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape', 'experience', 'positive'], [' the local vietnamese cuisine was a real treat', 'service', 'positive'], ['bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region', 'service', 'positive'], ['during our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience', 'experience', 'positive'], ["our time at memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey", 'experience', 'positive']]

270231,The hotel itself and the staff deserve a five star rating. The facilities of the hotel, the interior design, the standard of the rooms are high class. There is absolutely nothing missing to enjoy a wonderful stay. The Spa is well equipped, offers a great variety of treatments by experienced, well trained therapists. The restaurant on the basement floor offers a huge breakfast buffet, western and Asian style plus a menue. Lunch and dinner has separate menue with various dishes at reasonable prices. Service is attentive and especially at breakfast there is no request they wouldn't satisfy. Even for breakfast they ask for your allergies! There is a rooftop bar with happy hour and a view from the 5th floor. The other bar is in the lobby. My room offered much more than I expected: apart from safe, TV, hairdryer and water kettle, there is a fridge, free water, tea, coffee and fruits. The bed is so comfortable you don't want to get out, as is the linen and towels from very good quality. Enough plugs to recharge your electronic equipment. Lights are also good and enough. Bathroom with all amenities. Of course there is an elevator in the house. The location is great. The staff speaks good English and is more than helpful in any way.

The rest of the bathroom was well equipped and clean. The bed was comfortable and extra wide. The entire apartment was very clean and offered sweeping views across downtown Haiphong. Breakfast is a buffet with made to order Banh Da Cua (crab noodle soup) and eggs plus all the other bits you want, and great coffee.

276335,Great place, super clean and luxurious. Nice pool and in front of the beach! Far from any nice restaurants and the center, hopefully the area will get more developed with time. The breakfast on Booking was about 2usd per night per person, but when we wanted to buy it there, it was 6usd. So book it directly on booking.

The breakfast is plentiful and delicious, they have free bikes for use at any time, they offer free foot baths which we used and they brought to our rooms.

The bed in the room looks like a super king size! Shower was great too. Breakfast was good.

They even had a coffee pod machine and provided decaf pods which was amazing for me as I had not been able to get decaf anywhere else! The gym is great with good facilities, we had a lovely massage at the spa, and the pool area is gorgeous it’s just such a shame we couldn’t enjoy it as the weather was sadly terrible for entire duration of our stay!

276159,Very cheap room with breakfast included. The owners are such amazing persons, very kind, helpful, welcoming, friendly. I could keep saying more for a long time. Zu offered me the special rice wine alcool and chatted with me about everything I needed, gave me every explanations about what we can do. They can book anything for you (bus, trip...), they provide free bicycles to explore the area. They rent cheap motorbikes (150k VND). You can order tasty food anytime. Good AC in the dorms, good bed with curtains for each bed, lockers, clean room and bathroom. The hostel looks cute, the common area has nice decorations. And you are facing the beautiful river and mountains. There is also a peaceful terrace in front of the river where you can chill in a hammock, a bouncing bench or a table and enjoy the view. Also Zu speaks a perfect english ! The others persons working there are very nice and smiling all the time. They are very warm and welcoming persons. They make good food and fresh juices.

272484,Very kind family. Comfortable beds. Good value for money, the accommodation was about a 15 min walk (or 5 min cycling, you can borrow bikes from the family) from the centre of Tam Coc. We liked this because it was quiet at night so we could sleep well. Also the family is very kind and helped us with booking a tour for a discounted price to the national park, taught me how to ride a motorbike, and arranged door-to-door transport to cat ba for us at a good price. Also the father gave us a boat tour in an area with no other tourists, it was a very nice experience :) ####[['the accommodation was about a 15 min walk', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we liked this because it was quiet at night so we could sleep well', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the family is very kind and helped us with booking a tour for a discounted price to the national park, taught me how to ride a motorbike, and arranged door-to-door transport to cat ba for us at a good price', 'service', 'positive'], ['also the father gave us a boat tour in an area with no other tourists, it was a very nice experience', 'experience', 'positive']]

276283,It was a short stay, but very nice. The location itself is absolutely beautiful, with a nice garden with lots of plants, small pool, small ponds with water lily, very idilic. Thong and his wife are great people, very welcoming and helpful. Thong's mum is the one cooking and the food is simply delicious. Many of the guests choose to skip the breakfast at the Eco Lodge, in order to have the traditional noodle soup at the floating market. But we were so happy we chose to have breakfast here. At the floating market it is crowded, and i am unsure how clean everything is, as everything is washed with water from the river. But we made the best choice having breakfast cooked by Thong's mum. They also arranged floating market tour and taxi back to Saigon through their travel agent, Lily. All were extremly helpful. Please just be aware that at times it can get noisy if there is a wedding party nearby or any kind of celebration for that matter as karaoke will be sung to mark the occasion. Not only here, I mean, but in all areas of Mekong delta, as we were staying in diffrrent locations, to see different parts of the Delta. Best to have some ear plugs, just in case. Otherwise, please do not skip this accomodation, as it is beautiful.

There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful). ####[['comfortable bed. clean rooms', 'facility', 'positive'], ['great location', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' pool was nice', 'facility', 'positive'], ['brutal check out experience', 'service', 'negative'], ['they advertise 24 hour reception so i thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 am bus to the airport. there was nobody in reception except a security guard', 'branding', 'negative']]

274990,Room was quite small but was adequate. We were on the 14th floor directly below the pool, it has a nice view but unfortunately there is a constant noise that comes from the pool overflow. The breakfast buffet has a good selection with an egg station. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Pool is on the roof and has 4 sun loungers and a large umbrella. The hotel has free bicycle rental and also has scooters for hire for a reasonable daily fee. We rented the scooters on 2 different days and they did not require proof of a license, nor to fill out forms. The only downside is the location which is almost at the end of the bay. There are a lot of sea food restaurants near the hotel but not much else. The bicycle and scooter rentals does negate this problem. ####[['room was quite small', 'facility', 'negative'], ['it has a nice view', 'experience', 'positive'], ['there is a constant noise that comes from the pool overflow', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the breakfast buffet has a good selection with an egg station', 'service', 'positive'], ['staff are very friendly and helpful', 'service', 'positive'], ['pool is on the roof and has 4 sun loungers and a large umbrella', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the hotel has free bicycle rental', 'service', 'positive'], ['has scooters for hire for a reasonable daily fee', 'service', 'positive'], ['the only downside is the location', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['which is almost at the end of the bay', 'amenity', 'negative'], [' there are a lot of sea food restaurants near the hotel', 'amenity', 'positive']]

274345,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included. On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see. However, there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed. ####[['the boat itself is absolutely beautiful', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it feels magical', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the staff were extremely kind and welcoming', 'service', 'positive'], ['we did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized', 'service', 'positive'], ['kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in vietnam', 'experience', 'positive'], ['all the food was quite good and was included', 'service', 'positive'], [' if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood', 'service', 'positive'], [' the baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you can look out at the bay, which is great', 'experience', 'positive'], ['this ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay', 'branding', 'positive'], ['the balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures', 'facility', 'negative'], [' no drinks are included', 'service', 'negative'], ['the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying', 'service', 'negative'], ['it would be nice if they were included', 'service', 'neutral'], [' on the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see.', 'experience', 'positive'], [' there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed', 'experience', 'negative']]

Maybe only disappointment for myself was pool, but it's a good pool, very large with a small one to the side, I just prefer the open air one especially with that view.

Mr Trung was so sweet always sharing his fruit with us and when we left sent us off with apples and water bottles. He even drove us to the bus stop because we couldn’t find a grab to take us. Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone.

276626,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff! We were incredibly comfortable during our stay and felt like the team at Aira did so much to make sure all of our needs were met. The location was great for us - on the beach and so close to some great little restaurants, massage places, corner shops, etc. A long walk (maybe 50 minutes?) or inexpensive taxi into the city made us feel connected to the more active nightlife, but not as if it was in our face. Really, everything was great. The cost of this hotel was pricier than the other hotels we stayed in during our Vietnam trip, but this was something we felt okay with going into it and it never bothered us during our stay. Two swimming pools, a pool table, and a boutique hotel experience made it all feel pretty worth it! ####[['beautiful hotel', 'facility', 'positive'], ['wonderful staff', 'service', 'positive'], ['we were incredibly comfortable during our stay and felt like the team at aira did so much to make sure all of our needs were met', 'service', 'positive'], ['the location was great for us - on the beach and so close to some great little restaurants, massage places, corner shops, etc', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['a long walk (maybe 50 minutes?) or inexpensive taxi into the city made us feel connected to the more active nightlife', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['everything was great', 'experience', 'positive'], ['two swimming pools, a pool table, and a boutique hotel experience made it all feel pretty worth it', 'experience', 'positive'], ['but not as if it was in our face', 'experience', 'positive'], ['this was something we felt okay with going into it and it never bothered us during our stay', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the cost of this hotel was pricier than the other hotels we stayed in during our vietnam trip', 'experience', 'negative']]

You can order your breakfast (made to order), go to the beach, swim and when you come back, it's waiting for you in the room, where you can enjoy it in the spacious AC Room. I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos).

Ours was the only room on the top floor, so we essentially had our own private roof top terrace and pool. No issues with family (who are locals) coming and going as we pleased. Cafe downstairs makes great coffee and is open pretty late. We forgot to pay scooter rental at check out but Mr. Tran sent me an email and we settled the outstanding bill upon our return from a side-trip without penalty or other issue. Advertised as having in-room washer, but it did not, although it was still conveniently located in the stairwell in the hallway outside our room, and staff allowed us to use the dryer in the basement. Bathroom door did not stay closed on its own - we had to prop it closed with the garbage can. Bathroom walls could have used a good wipe down, and we noticed some ants in the kitchen area after cooking one night, but they were gone once the room was serviced and the garbage had been removed. They requested cash payment upon check-in although we booked with a card. ####[['staff was was super nice and accommodating', 'service', 'positive'], ['room was large and view was great', 'facility', 'positive'], ['ours was the only room on the top floor, so we essentially had our own private roof top terrace and pool', 'facility', 'positive'], ['cafe downstairs makes great coffee and is open pretty late.', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we forgot to pay scooter rental at check out but mr. tran sent me an email and we settled the outstanding bill upon our return from a side-trip without penalty or other issue', 'service', 'positive'], [' advertised as having in-room washer, but it did not', 'branding', 'negative'], ['bathroom door did not stay closed on its own', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we had to prop it closed with the garbage can', 'facility', 'negative'], [' bathroom walls could have used a good wipe down', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['we noticed some ants in the kitchen area after cooking one night, but they were gone once the room was serviced and the garbage had been removed', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['they requested cash payment upon check-in although we booked with a card', 'service', 'negative']]

271155,We arrived late to this charming hotel, check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade. Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it's a little out of the way.

272644,I love the view of the city from the window and the bed was decent comfortable. There was a washing machine we could use (but no drying just hanging). We also enjoy the pool and stores close by. It need to be upkeep better, it was a let down from the pictures. Little things like getting a new floor mat (it was terribly old and dirty) could make it so much better. The sink needs fixing and generally just everything looks old and dated. And since it’s rented out by owner, no room cleaning. Not worth the money I pay for. ####[['i love the view of the city from the window', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the bed was decent comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there was a washing machine we could use', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we also enjoy the pool and stores close by', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it need to be upkeep better, it was a let down from the pictures', 'branding', 'negative'], ['little things like getting a new floor mat (it was terribly old and dirty) could make it so much better', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the sink needs fixing and generally just everything looks old and dated', 'facility', 'negative'], ['since it’s rented out by owner, no room cleaning. not worth the money i pay for', 'service', 'negative']]

This also created the extra trouble of having to change room the next day. Breakfast was basic and by 8am, there is hardly any food left. Rooftop swimming pool was not available for use.

However, the highlight for me was the stunning pool, where I spent many relaxing moments and admired the beautiful surroundings. Additionally, sitting on the balcony and enjoying a drink was a delightful experience. Hannah, the host, was simply fantastic. She was incredibly kind and helpful throughout my stay, providing valuable suggestions on local attractions and activities. Thanks to Hannah's support, I had an incredible travel experience without any issues. I am genuinely satisfied with my stay and cannot wait to return. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a memorable vacation. Not only does it boast an excellent location, but it is also comfortable and well-equipped.

275858,I am a foreigner living and working here. Sometimes it is also easy to change the wind to go to the hotel to rest on the weekend. I go to District 7 a lot, but from my point of view, it's relatively good here. The hotel room has a combination of apartments, so it is very convenient for those who go in groups or want to relax and relieve stress on the weekend like me. Spacious and airy patio. Located right in the center but not noisy because the room is very soundproof. Everyone should try it. ####[["from my point of view, it's relatively good here", 'experience', 'positive'], ['the hotel room has a combination of apartments', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it is very convenient for those who go in groups or want to relax and relieve stress on the weekend like me', 'experience', 'positive'], ['spacious and airy patio', 'facility', 'positive'], ['located right in the center but not noisy', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the room is very soundproof', 'facility', 'positive'], ['everyone should try it', 'loyalty', 'positive']]
271768,Halong Bay is a must when you travel to Vietnam, and there are many options out there. We did a lot of research on the number of days to stay on the boat and also, which company to use. We opted for Le Theatre cruise 2 days 1 Night (2D1N), because of the itinerary and the activities. The boat itself is very luxurious and you feel like a star when the crew welcomes you on board. The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free! Views were absolutely incredible from that room. The food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated. Highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip. Make sure to book the luxury limousine transport from Hanoi to the boat, it's worth it!!! Thanks to everyone who helped us during our stay, you guys were absolutely wonderful. ####[['the boat itself is very luxurious and you feel like a star when the crew welcomes you on board', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free', 'service', 'positive'], ['views were absolutely incredible from that room', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated', 'service', 'positive'], ['highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip', 'loyalty', 'positive'], [' thanks to everyone who helped us during our stay', 'service', 'positive'], ['you guys were absolutely wonderful', 'service', 'positive']]

271683,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules. ####[['the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish', 'facility', 'positive'], [' the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful', 'service', 'positive'], ['i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out', 'service', 'positive'], ['good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in', 'service', 'positive'], [' there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs', 'experience', 'negative'], ["after i left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore ", 'service', 'negative'], [" i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k", 'service', 'negative'], [' i felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet', 'service', 'negative'], ['i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules', 'service', 'negative']]

273545,All the staff were lovely. In particular Thuy and Ahn. We were made to feel like family and they went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. The hotel owner was also lovely, she even gifted us on departure, which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture .The team of staff are very small and we’re mostly all lovely. The rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid. Breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of Vietnamese options, but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful. The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast (they don’t usually have this on the menu. The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel. If I have to be picky, it was probably further away from market then we imagined. But it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills. He could see we were checking out and lots of suitcases, given we had to walk down three flights of stairs, he could have at least offered to assist. He’s probably the worst concierge I’ve dealt with in my time in Vietnam . But he wasn’t enough to ruin my stay. I still had a wonderful time Look into tours (prices, and itinerary) before booking with him. ####[['all the staff were lovely', 'service', 'positive'], ['we were made to feel like family and they went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable', 'service', 'positive'], ['the hotel owner was also lovely, she even gifted us on departure, which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture', 'service', 'positive'], ['the team of staff are very small and we’re mostly all lovely', 'service', 'positive'], ['the rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid', 'facility', 'positive'], [' breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of vietnamese options, but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast', 'service', 'positive'], ['the pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot hoi an summer heat', 'facility', 'positive'], ['overall excellent value for money', 'experience', 'positive'], [' it was probably further away from market then we imagined', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['but it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' can work on his customer service skills', 'service', 'positive'], ['he could see we were checking out and lots of suitcases, given we had to walk down three flights of stairs, he could have at least offered to assist', 'service', 'negative'], ['he’s probably the worst concierge i’ve dealt with in my time in vietnam', 'service', 'negative'], [' but he wasn’t enough to ruin my stay', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['i still had a wonderful time', 'experience', 'positive'], [' look into tours', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' before booking with him', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['there wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel', 'experience', 'neutral']]

Things were broken a lot. Gecko in the room ran inside the AC. AC broke down, was fixed immediately, but I hope the little guy got out. Internet was choppy, just little things here and there, wall paper ripped off in some parts, I could hear the neighbors whispering and having sex next door (the rooms are connected by a thin locked door). Housekeeping came and banged on the door like the Gestapo while we were asleep. Another time I was waiting for the cleaning lady in the hall to clean before an interview I was going to have. I waited for half an hour and decided to put the do not disturb sign up as i was having an interview online. Guess who started banging during the interview?

270122,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you.. ####[['they were all very nice', 'branding', 'positive'], ['the hotel is really central', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the lady was very nice to us', 'service', 'positive'], ['but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport', 'experience', 'negative'], ['when we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us', 'service', 'positive'], [' the small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the hotel is ok, not fancy ', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside', 'amenity', 'negative'], [' we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money', 'service', 'negative'], ["it wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed", 'service', 'negative'], ["i'd definitely not recommend this hotel", 'loyalty', 'negative']]

275011,The service at this hotel is exceptional! The hotel manager, “My” was unbelievably great. She always enquired about our stay, was always helpful and went out of her way to help us in a family emergency that required one of us to go to the hospital. She helped us book a cruise trip to Ha Long Bay, but my mother fell in on the way required her to be hospitalised in a town half way there. “My” helped us book a car at reasonable rates from Hanoi to pick us up after our mother was discharged from the hospital. Other members of staff were also very helpful with exchanging money and recommending good places to visit. The hotel is conveniently located, near many trendy coffee shops, local restaurants and the famous Bahn Mi 25 sandwich shop. We had a family room with one double bed and one queen bed. Shower had good water pressure also. The first room was quite dark, but I asked if we could change rooms and they immediately allowed us to change to a brighter room without any fuss whatsoever.

273383,We were received by Mr. Danh and his wife, who both run this motel. Such a warm and friendly welcome! They even texted us before our arrival to check if we had any trouble locating the property. We were doing a motorcycle trip in Vietnam, and were riding from Hue to Hoi An. Decided to stop by Canh Duong Motel for a night's rest. Motel is easy to locate on Google Maps, situated next to a beach with PLENTY of seafood restaurants to choose from. Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem. Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us. Our room had very clean and shiny tiled floors, large bathroom with great water pressure and heated water. Air-conditioning worked very well. Many reviews highlighted the firm bed, but it is actually firm yet comfortable! Power socket points were convenient. Accomodation was perfect!

There is such kind staff in the breakfast, so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy. My bed and pillows were so comfortable (standard double room) and a really nice marble shower. I did not have a window but i wouldn’t have opened it bc the a/c was on and i wouldn’t want to let mosquitos in. The room did not need a window, it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished — the designer of the hotel had very good taste. Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby!

270048,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet. Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue. ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'facility', 'positive'], ['breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day', 'service', 'positive'], ['laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great', 'service', 'positive'], ['location - whilst not the most central location', 'amenity', 'neutral'], [" the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab app as we only had a local electronic sim", 'service', 'positive'], ['my husband loved the free gym', 'facility', 'positive'], [' we did love our stay', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'experience', 'positive']]

271307,Everything!! Very luxurious stay, beautiful rooms, spotlessly clean. Breakfast was fantastic, very rich selection (although only once was extremely busy). Staff is super friendly and helpful. There's laundry service too. They collected our clothes and handed them back to us within less than 2 hours. Perfect location. In fact, we decided to stay ine extra night. Highly recommended. The only fault i could find was that sometimes I could hear drainage noises during the night. They were quite loud but they were occasional. ####[['very luxurious stay, beautiful rooms, spotlessly clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['breakfast was fantastic, very rich selection', 'service', 'positive'], ['staff is super friendly and helpful', 'service', 'positive'], ["there's laundry service too", 'service', 'positive'], ['they collected our clothes and handed them back to us within less than 2 hours', 'service', 'positive'], [' perfect location', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we decided to stay ine extra night', 'loyalty', 'positive'], [' highly recommended', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['the only fault i could find was that sometimes i could hear drainage noises during the night', 'experience', 'negative']]
276918,The hotel is one street away from the beach and offers rooms with a view to the sea. The room was clean and really well furnished. We didn’t have any problems with street noise. The service in the hotel was super helpful and polite. Especially at the restaurant from Thuan and Nhi (thanks again). The breakfast was always plenty full, tasty and regional, changing every day with mostly Vietnamese food and a few western options. For my taste there could be more options of western food for breakfast, for example variations of cheese and sausages and also jams and chocolate spreads. ####[['the hotel is one street away from the beach and offers rooms', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['a view to the sea', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the room was clean and really well furnished', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we didn’t have any problems with street noise', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the service in the hotel was super helpful and polite', 'service', 'positive'], ['the breakfast was always plenty full, tasty and regional, changing every day with mostly vietnamese food and a few western options', 'service', 'positive']]

272185,New hotel, very friendly staff - they want that your rest would be beautiful and do it, tell you all about Da Nang, things and give advice where you can go and what you can see. Hotel placed outside of loud center, near are more fish restaurants, bars, and snacks points. Hotel placed in first line (need cross the way) and you can swim anytime any where, look at the fishers, take a sup or kayak etc. We took a motorbike (in hotel) and across all around. For motorbike is enough your driver license (with B category), no need special license (for example A category or Vietnam license). Our recommendation what you should see: Da Nang bridges, Lady Buddha, Marmor mountains, and of course Ba na hils - for our opinion the Golden bridge is too advertised, but everything else is just fantastic - castles on top of the mountain, Buddhist temples and statues, pagodas, various gardens - just amazing!!!, attractions (everything is included in the ticket price) - this will definitely not leave you indifferent. This is not a negative comment, but just a small nuance - the toilet is located in your room behind an opaque glass partition - you do not have to be a stiff family to live here :) ####[['hotel placed outside of loud center, near are more fish restaurants, bars, and snacks points', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the toilet is located in your room behind an opaque glass partition', 'facility', 'neutral']]

273145,The staff were by far the most kind and caring people I've met in Vietnam so far. They really took care of me, making sure I was okay as a solo female traveller. Making sure I ate and giving me fruits of they learned that I skip a meal (I wasn't hungry, but I'll take fruits anytime haha). It was warm and cosy, and felt like I was staying with a family. Also loved that it's across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market, so you don't get bothered by loud noises late at night, but yet near enough to walk. ####[["the staff were by far the most kind and caring people i've met in vietnam so far", 'service', 'positive'], ['they really took care of me, making sure i was okay as a solo female traveller', 'service', 'positive'], [' making sure i ate and giving me fruits of they learned that i skip a meal', 'service', 'positive'], [' it was warm and cosy, and felt like i was staying with a family', 'experience', 'positive'], ["also loved that it's across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market, so you don't get bothered by loud noises late at night, but yet near enough to walk", 'amenity', 'positive']]

271433,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill. There are lots of hotels in the area - I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price. ####[['good location around 5 minutes from the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the rooftop pool had a good view across the city.', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the hotel was very noisy', 'experience', 'negative'], ["we told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy", 'service', 'negative'], ['the hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating', 'branding', 'negative'], ['the pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill', 'branding', 'negative'], ['i wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price', 'branding', 'negative']]

273575,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard. In short, our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism. I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere. It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal. ####[['my stay at landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare', 'experience', 'negative'], [' the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous', 'service', 'neutral'], ['the person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic englis', 'service', 'negative'], ['in a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options', 'service', 'negative'], ['he tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times!', 'service', 'negative'], ['who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits', 'service', 'negative'], ['the deceit didn’t stop there', 'service', 'negative'], [' the owner switched our booking from the modern landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing landmark 1 tower', 'service', 'negative'], ['this was a complete bait and switch', 'service', 'negative'], [' it left us feeling utterly duped', 'experience', 'negative'], [' the apartment itself was a disaster', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the furniture was old, worn, and filthy', 'facility', 'negative'], [' the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online', 'branding', 'negative'], ['it was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration.', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the ac unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water', 'facility', 'negative'], ['it was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard', 'experience', 'negative'], [' our stay at landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism', 'experience', 'negative'], ['i urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere', 'loyalty', 'negative'], [' it’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal', 'experience', 'negative']]

271626,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you.... ####[['overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night', 'facility', 'positive'], ["the staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to hue and sun world for our daughter's birthday ", 'service', 'positive'], ['breakfast is great in the hotel', 'service', 'positive'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['our girls loved crazy cow ice cream and we also visited the dragon bridge on the saturday night', 'experience', 'positive']]

Villa was spacious with 2 rooms and living hall. We asked about bike rental she immediately provided bike keys. Since there was a language barrier as soon as we call her she was coming near property I had messaged about arrival as it was not seen by owner, owner was not available near property when we arrived. Neighbour of that property helped us to communicate with her as she doesnt speak English. It took 15 mins for her to arrive near property till that time her neighbour provided chairs to wait near their house. Bed is hard like a rock.

270180,Lovely new bungalow overlooking the rice fields and mountains. A perfect location for a quiet break, some fresh air and an opportunity to absorb the local scenery and culture. Hostess Ngân welcomed us upon our arrival. She was always very keen to ensure that we enjoyed our stay and had everything we needed. Ngân provided a laundry service and cooked some delicious breakfasts and dinners each day - which saved having to walk to the other local restaurants. And also provided a taste of local food using freshly produced ingredients. Bikes were provided to allow you cycle around the rice fields and discover the small villages and meet the very friendly locals. The homestay is located within a small group of houses which allowed interaction with the locals which added to the enjoyment of the experience. The room was spotlessly clean with a large toilet/bathroom. A highly recommended homestay when visiting Mai Cháu.

273965,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy. ####[['i recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'experience', 'positive'], [' its prime location opposite the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' attentive staff', 'service', 'positive'], ['impressive use of crabtree & evelyn products, my overall experience was positive', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'service', 'negative'], [" i suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'service', 'negative'], [' it would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'service', 'neutral'], [' this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'service', 'neutral']]

The view from the pool is breathtaking, the staff really helpful and as a bonus during really hot days: the pool is in the shade of the 22nd floor in the afternoon. The beach view rooms come with one little drawback: music playing through the night on the beach audible even on the higher floors with windows closed. For guests with light sleep, city view might be a good consideration (not a bad view anyhow - see photo). Closing time of the rooftop bar at 22:00 is something guests have to count with. We arrived late in the evening and had no option anymore for a drink or snack in the hotel. ####[['helpfull staff', 'service', 'positive'], [' great location', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['really nice facilities', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the lady behind the counter in the breakfast restaurant makes a great omelette', 'service', 'positive'], [' the rooftop bar and pool are one big reason to stay here', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the view from the pool is breathtaking', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the staff really helpful', 'service', 'positive'], ['music playing through the night on the beach audible even on the higher floors with windows closed', 'experience', 'negative'], ['for guests with light sleep, city view might be a good consideration', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' closing time of the rooftop bar at 22:00 is something guests have to count with', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['we arrived late in the evening and had no option anymore for a drink or snack in the hotel', 'experience', 'negative']]

273767,It was very affordable and in a good location. It's close to My Anh Beach and the restaurants of An Thương. The private rooms are still at great prices, and come with a kettle, sink, and private bathroom. And the renter can control the air conditioner.

In the group rooms, the air conditioner is only turned on from 9pm to 7am, so the room is too hot to be in during the daytime.

It does need a bit more attention to cleaning in general. Shower was good but shower head to low for me. In fairness they're probably built at local regulations and not designed for taller people.

The bath tub has absolutely no view ( the only reason we booked this property).The linen of the bed was not fresh as of it was a used one. The outside area of the hotel is also not clean. When we reached there was nobody at the reception & just a phone no. Mentioned to call some one. Now imagine a person from outside country may not have calling accessibility then how will they call? Our taxi driver helped us for the same. The staff ( lady) was trying to be nice when we expressed our un likeness of the room & said we are giving you scooty rental in discount but later we came to know that she actually charged a higher amount from us then available outside. The breakfast was also very average, mostly bread was given & no butter. Only when asked it was provided... No eggs or anything.. we totally regret our decision to book this property. Pls stay somewhere closer to the beach..it is more better location & still close to every spot you might wanna visit. ####[['the rooms are very big', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the linen of the bed was not fresh as of it was a used one. the outside area of the hotel is also not clean', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we were allotted a room on the ground floor', 'service', 'negative'], ['the bath tub has absolutely no view', 'facility', 'negative'], ['when we reached there was nobody at the reception ', 'service', 'negative'], ['the staff ( lady) was trying to be nice when we expressed our un likeness of the room & said we are giving you scooty rental in discount but later we came to know that she actually charged a higher amount from us then available outside', 'service', 'negative'], ['the breakfast was also very average, mostly bread was given & no butter', 'service', 'neutral'], ['only when asked it was provided', 'service', 'negative'], ['we totally regret our decision to book this property', 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['the pics of which is not shown in here & is total scam', 'branding', 'negative']]

You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe. I wouldn't recommend this place for those with small children because the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child-friendly. ####[['the place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews', 'branding', 'positive'], ['the owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room', 'service', 'positive'], [' it was very spacious', 'facility', 'positive'], ['she also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed', 'service', 'positive'], ['overall, we were very impressed with the hospitality', 'experience', 'positive'], [' there was some parking space in front of the villa itself ', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ['some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim', 'facility', 'negative'], ["i wouldn't recommend this place for those with small children", 'loyalty', 'negative'], [' the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child-friendly', 'facility', 'negative']]

There were limited options at breakfast, which was just ok. That was not a huge issue, though, because we wanted to explore the food in the city.

The rooms are as pictured so there are some gaps in the roof for insects to enter the room but this is the only thing I can think of - do not let it put you off. ####[['beautiful little homestay with a lovely pool', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the family is very welcoming', 'service', 'positive'], ['our host helped organise motorbike rental and travel back to hanoi as well as helping when my partner got stung', 'service', 'positive'], ['the location is a 2 minute bike to the main area and also only a 15 minute motorbike ride to the nearest tourist activity', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['good ac, showers and wifi', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooms are as pictured', 'branding', 'positive'], ['there are some gaps in the roof for insects to enter the room', 'facility', 'negative']]

However I would recommend the steakhouse. The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room. Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn’t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up. I stayed there this time last year and the service was much better so it’s definitely gone downhill. I spoke to the manager about it and they did let me extend my checkout time for free as compensation.

While the pool is a nice addition, it's rather small. The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice.

Not a bad place but quite remote (I knew that when I booked) and not very welcoming... No one speaks English so they are probably shy to interact. When I arrived they called a lady from next door who speaks English but my check in was just efficient, not really any explainations or recommandations. Then I didn't see anyone the rest of the day. In the morning I had breakfast included but it was really poor. Plain eggs with tasteless bread, weird juice and bad coffee... The lady disappeared straight after bringing me the food so I couldn't make any comment or ask for anything more... Finally at check out a very smiley lady asked me to put a 10 rating on Booking..... Sorry but no way. You need to do better than that. PS : there is water in the room like in many places in SE Asia, but here you have to pay for it...

Apart from the western menu, rest of the food was exceptional. This is the one of the beautiful resort, I have stayed. Usually we are going to the beachside, not countryside. Therefore, I really enjoyed the view and the climate. The quality of the Western food that served in the resort was not that good. Foe example, we had BBQ Pork Ribs which were really hard to cut the meat and not that taste. Usually this is not the case. Also, the reception staff is lack of communication. We booked a car for airport drop off much more early, but we were picked up after 30 mins late. So it seems the staff did not do the proper communications with the driver.

The guesthouse is well located and there are lots of nice shops, little coffee shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Not too far from the night market, maybe 10 minutes by foot. It's great value for money! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying. It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not.

275808,The staff was lovely. Food was nice. Comfortable beds. First of all, it was tiny. We could barely fit our two suitcases in it. Secondly, there was no windows. From the windows we saw in photos one was to the bathroom, and the other one opened into the inside of the building (with mouldy walls). This meant that there was no fresh air, and the room was dark, hot and stuffy. Everything was moist and smelled like mould. Every morning we woke up with a headache and after a couple days started getting ill. Our clothes were constantly damp and smelly. Every evening we dreaded getting back to that room. Our toilet broke on the 3rd day and we were put in a different room for one night while they fixed it - that room was much nicer and didn’t smell, but the windows weren’t soundproof and we couldn’t sleep all night because of how loud it was. As we were pretty jet lagged we wanted to sleep in and left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door every morning, but every morning we were woken up by staff being loud outside our door. From around 7am to 11 there was always someone shouting, talking, making phone calls, hoovering etc, and we could hear everything like they were in our room. There were little ants everywhere. The shower door didn’t close. The room was cleaned every day but not very well.

The bed was super comfy though the pillows were a bit tough for me. The owner of the hotel is a nice friendly lady, she even gave me a lift to the bus station!

Surrounding area still much to be desired. As for Quality of Rooms its Excellent. For a Foreigner i had to rely on Ehailing or Taxi but during my stay it was a bit difficult to get one.

275979,The villa is perfect for family trip, very large dinning area with kitchen connection to huge living room which became the wonderful place for gathering, talking and chat. it is also equipped with many kitchenware and tableware which can provide enough for more than 10 people.

Unfortunately we came there during the bad weather (tropical depression) and it rained heavily all days. The electricity went on and off in 2 days (for the whole surround affected place, not only the house) and it lacked of candles, gas for the mini cooker to prepare for the meals until I contacted the host to bring us some.

Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages. Finally, the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue ####[['beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature, with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the thai food was also very good and cheap', 'service', 'positive'], ['surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude', 'service', 'neutral'], ['i understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude', 'service', 'negative'], ['italians and having italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused', 'service', 'negative'], ['in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages', 'service', 'negative'], ['the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue', 'experience', 'negative']]

273387,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed. Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste. ####[['incredibly comfortable bed', 'facility', 'positive'], ['great location', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements', 'service', 'positive'], ['beautifully designed', 'facility', 'positive'], ['many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience', 'facility', 'negative'], ['some elements already are showing wear and tear', 'facility', 'negative'], ['for a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward', 'service', 'negative'], ['we also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception', 'service', 'negative'], ['when we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves', 'service', 'negative'], ['known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste', 'service', 'negative'], ['the cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed', 'service', 'negative']]

Also, she did my laundry "express," night before, and it was done and amazing with 2 hours - before I went to bed. She also arranged a taxi to the bus station. Their rental motorbikes for the Ha Giang Loop are the best condition and value. I rode one of their Honda 110cc Semiautomatics on a 2 day self guided tour. It was almost new and worked perfectly. The beds and shower/bathrooms were very clean and cozy. Their kitchen served tasty eats. Oh, and they provided a nice secure cage to lock up my large backpack while I carried my small one on the 2 day ride. I brought my own lock, but they probably have some to loan.. The Bong is the bomb - in Ha Giang! Someone might have been smoking in the basement bar/pool room. But, it didn't linger up to the sleep or dining area.

276145,The only good thing about the hotel was our room but I have to mention the fact that we had the Luxury Double room so we had a big room and those are located on the higher floors (we were on floor 20) so you have a nice view and the room is bright and not tooo loud. The staff on the ground floor and the reception was also very lovely. When we saw the photos of the hotel on booking we of course were amazed by the breathtaking photos of the swimming pool on the rooftop. As we knew it will be around 37 degrees in the city during our stay that was a main fact why we booked the hotel. DON’T BE BLINDED BY THOSE PHOTOS! The pool is huge and the view is nice - yess. BUT the water is disgusting. You don’t see it immediately because of the colourful mosaik floor but when you take a look closer you will see parts of old tissues and other dirt swimming in the pool. The rooftop area is huge but there are only a few possibilities (around 5-6 daybeds) to relax in the shadow and they are taken from early morning by people who are staying there all they long. THIS IS INSANE as the hotel must have hundreds of rooms!!!! When we went up there we had to sit on a bar chair at a high bar table without any shadow (not to mention that the whole exterior is old, dirty and completely uncomfortable) and we saw more and more people arriving at the rooftop just like us being disappointed by the fact that they just didn’t get any space to sit so they just left. I later found out that the rooftop area is not only exclusive for the guests but open for random guests and there is even free access from 4pm!! So the rooftop is actually a public swimming pool for 8 million people living in the city and not part of the 5star hotel you are paying for. This was so disappointing and we would never come back. As much as attentive the staff in the lobby was, less so the staff on the rooftop took any care of the fact that hotel guests were sitting on the concrete floor (there is a small concrete “island” in the centre of the pool) or cleaning dirt from people who already left…. ####[['the only good thing about the hotel was our room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you have a nice view', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the room is bright and not tooo loud', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the reception was also very lovely', 'service', 'positive'], ['the pool is huge and the view is nice', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the water is disgusting', 'facility', 'negative'], ['when you take a look closer you will see parts of old tissues and other dirt swimming in the pool', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the rooftop area is huge but there are only a few possibilities (around 5-6 daybeds) to relax in the shadow', 'facility', 'positive'], ['this is insane as the hotel must have hundreds of rooms', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we had to sit on a bar chair at a high bar table without any shadow', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['the whole exterior is old, dirty and completely uncomfortable', 'facility', 'negative'], ['more people arriving at the rooftop just like us being disappointed by the fact that they just didn’t get any space to sit so they just left', 'experience', 'negative'], ['i later found out that the rooftop area is not only exclusive for the guests but open for random guests and there is even free access from 4pm', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the rooftop is actually a public swimming pool for 8 million people living in the city and not part of the 5star hotel you are paying for', 'service', 'negative'], ['this was so disappointing and we would never come back', 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['less so the staff on the rooftop took any care of the fact that hotel guests were sitting on the concrete floor', 'service', 'negative'], ['cleaning dirt from people who already left', 'service', 'negative']]

272678,The spa exceeded my expectations. 2 hours massage + 50 min salt scrub. They have a promo so it's really great value for money. Loved the aroma sea salt scrub - they use coarse salt and my skin feels so smooth even 1 week later. Staff were helpful as well. Bicycles are free for hotel guests to use so one can cycle around the ancient town area though navigating the roads is quite challenging during peak hours. Room is reasonably clean and neat. Laundry service was by load and very reasonably priced. The hot water was fluctuating between very hot and cold but minor issue, just shower quicker. Bath tub is above average height so it takes quite a bit of effort to climb out safely as the tiles are quite smooth and there was no appropriate grab rails. ####[["the spa exceeded my expectations. 2 hours massage + 50 min salt scrub. they have a promo so it's really great value for money", 'branding', 'positive'], ['loved the aroma sea salt scrub - they use coarse salt and my skin feels so smooth even 1 week later', 'experience', 'positive'], ['staff were helpful as well', 'service', 'positive'], ['bicycles are free for hotel guests to use so one can cycle around the ancient town area though navigating the roads is quite challenging during peak hours', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['room is reasonably clean and neat', 'facility', 'positive'], ['laundry service was by load and very reasonably priced', 'service', 'positive'], ['the hot water was fluctuating between very hot and cold but minor issue, just shower quicker', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['bath tub is above average height so it takes quite a bit of effort to climb out safely as the tiles are quite smooth and there was no appropriate grab rails', 'facility', 'negative']]

275814,The staff was extremely helpfuly. Unfortunately, we spotted a cockroach in the hotel room in the morning after breakfast. Because it was just before check out, it wasn’t a big deal for us, but if we had spotted it the night before I would not have been able to sleep. At checkout, Jack, the receptionist asked if everything had been to our liking, we said yes, i did mention the cockroach, not to complain (i understand it is impossible to avoid cockroaches completely) but just for their awareness/prevention, and thanked them for everything. Jack went above and beyond to excuse himself for this (we said it was fine!), offered to provide us free transportation to the airport (we refused as it was fine!) and eventually offered us a monetary compensation for the inconvenience. Jack also provided us with complimentary bottles of water, which was a nice touch. Not specific to this property, but to almost all hotels/restaurants in Vietnam - the pressure to provide a good review. It just ruins the whole experience. I understand the pressure the workers go through to have good reviews (as i understand, at least for some, their salaries are dependent on these reviews), which i think is a shame. I hope employees will change this reward/salary policy soon, as it does not help the customers nor the employees. We, customers, find the service good, are happy about it, just to learn it was all for a good review that the employees all desperate to get. My respect for the employees who have to work under these conditions. ####[['the staff was extremely helpfuly', 'service', 'positive'], ['we spotted a cockroach in the hotel room in the morning', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the night before i would not have been able to sleep', 'experience', 'negative'], ['ack went above and beyond to excuse himself for this', 'service', 'positive'], ['offered to provide us free transportation to the airport', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['eventually offered us a monetary compensation for the inconvenience', 'service', 'positive'], ['jack also provided us with complimentary bottles of water, which was a nice touch', 'service', 'positive']]

274989,This hotel is well situated on a quiet lane in the Old Quarter and is an easy walking distance to the many sights. The staff were exceptional and always made sure they warmly greeted me whether I was going out or returning.

Breakfast was included with a good selection including noodle soup on request. The hotel was well maintained and I appreciated having an elevator and old wifi.

Be warned that there is no AC and the fans are standing fans so did not offer much relief from the oppressive heat. If you are a heat lover then this shouldn’t be an issue. i wouldn’t recommend if you have children under the age of 15.

276030,Hanoi Esplendor Hotel is a great place to stay when visiting Hanoi. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful in particular Chris and Lena of the front desk.

274432,The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl. They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling. The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town. It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather. ####[["the hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest i've met during my travesl", 'service', 'positive'], ['they always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling', 'service', 'positive'], [' the rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i really liked the storage arrangment', 'facility', 'positive'], [' i decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['the main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the way there is exposed with no ceiling', 'facility', 'negative'], ['on my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and i had to go to the bathroom', 'experience', 'negative'], [' i had no choice but to get completely wet on my way', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well', 'experience', 'negative'], [" there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel", 'facility', 'negative'], ["another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min", 'amenity', 'negative'], ['climb up the hill from town', 'amenity', 'negative'], [" it's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather", 'experience', 'negative']]

The cook Hương was always smiling and she deserves to be mentioned. Her Banana Pancakes are very popular ! Really you will not regret if you book this place!

272189,The hotel was well located, just across the road from the beach. The hotel was quite modern and was excellent value for money. Staff were very good and the hotel was very accomodating. They allowed us to alter our booking one day before we were due to check in which was very much appreciated. The breakfast had a lot of variety with mainly Vietnamese food but also some western options. The quality of the breakfast was just OK. The main downside of this hotel was the number of people - it was very hectic, especially at breakfast time where there were big crowds of people scrambling for food. The constant crowds detracted from the ambience of the hotel. ####[['the hotel was well located, just across the road from the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the hotel was quite modern and was excellent value for money', 'facility', 'positive'], ['staff were very good and the hotel was very accomodating', 'service', 'positive'], ['they allowed us to alter our booking one day before we were due to check in which was very much appreciated', 'service', 'positive'], ['the breakfast had a lot of variety with mainly vietnamese food but also some western options', 'service', 'positive'], ['the quality of the breakfast was just ok', 'service', 'neutral'], ['the main downside of this hotel was the number of people - it was very hectic, especially at breakfast time where there were big crowds of people scrambling for food', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the constant crowds detracted from the ambience of the hotel.', 'experience', 'negative']]
