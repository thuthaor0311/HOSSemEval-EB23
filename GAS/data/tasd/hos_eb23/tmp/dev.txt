276229,- The breakfast was very good, there are several options to choose which the owner will cook for you and it will be accompanied with fresh fruit (in a generous portion). Sometimes they even surprised us with additional spring rolls or banana pancakes which were delicious.- The location is midway between the beach and the old town, which can be both reached very easily by bike in 10-15 minutes (the owner lend us the bikes for free!). It is also just beside the rice fields, so you can take a small walk and admire the beautiful landscape. There are also minimarket/restaurants/pharmacies nearby that you can reach by walking in case of need.- The best of all was of course the owner which made us feel just like home with her energy and her generosity. She also helped us to book the tours we wanted to take around Hoi An. When we come back to Hoi An (which we will do for sure!), we will definitely be staying here again. Everything was amazing, and for the price we paid we would even say it exceeded our expectations! ####[['the breakfast was very good, there are several options to choose which the owner will cook for you and it will be accompanied with fresh fruit', 'service', 'positive'], ['sometimes they even surprised us with additional spring rolls or banana pancakes which were delicious', 'service', 'positive'], ['the location is midway between the beach and the old town, which can be both reached very easily by bike in 10-15 minutes', 'service', 'positive'], ['the owner lend us the bikes for free', 'service', 'positive'], ['it is also just beside the rice fields, so you can take a small walk', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['admire the beautiful landscape', 'experience', 'positive'], ['there are also minimarket/restaurants/pharmacies nearby that you can reach by walking in case of need', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the best of all was of course the owner which made us feel just like home with her energy and her generosity', 'service', 'positive'], ['she also helped us to book the tours we wanted to take around hoi an', 'service', 'positive'], ['when we come back to hoi an (which we will do for sure!), we will definitely be staying here again', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['everything was amazing', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the price we paid we would even say it exceeded our expectations', 'experience', 'positive']]

273490,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances. ####[['very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool', 'facility', 'positive'], ['breakfast was very good and a sensible price', 'service', 'positive'], ['if we were going back to hoi an we would go to the thanh binh central hotel', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['a short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the mural of the japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['we had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that', 'service', 'neutral'], ['a sketch map would have been useful', 'experience', 'positive'], [' it turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly', 'service', 'positive'], [' he rushed off and quickly came back with another key card', 'service', 'positive'], ['obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['we were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade', 'experience', 'positive'], [' whilst it lacked a couple of thing', 'facility', 'negative'], ['it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom', 'facility', 'positive'], ['to the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances', 'service', 'negative']]

274104,The hotel is reasonably close to the tourist Hoan Kiem area and is just a 5 minute walk to the Eco Sapa bus station (mostly under cover if raining).

276636,We really love the location of this place and we made the right decision to book. The property is located in a quiet street so you can sleep well at night. The hotel is also very convenient and accessible to food stores, grocery and attractions. The nearest attraction can only be walked less that 1 kilometer which is the St Joseph Cathedral and the farthest would be 3 kilometers. We also like the Wifi connection it’s very fast. We like the big window facing the city view. We also like the put “don’t disturb” or “clean” sign that you can show outside your door. The receptionist was accommodating and nice. The safety box was not working. So we had to always secure our valuables ourselves. There was unpleasant smell in the room. It seems like smoke from outside gets inside our room even if window is closed and especially the AC is turned on you can still smell it. I wish they could put good smell to the room. ####[['we really love the location of this place and we made the right decision to book', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the property is located in a quiet street so you can sleep well at night', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the hotel is also very convenient and accessible to food stores, grocery and attractions', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the nearest attraction can only be walked less that 1 kilometer which is the st joseph cathedral and the farthest would be 3 kilometers', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ['we also like the wifi connection it’s very fast', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we like the big window facing the city view', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we also like the put “don’t disturb” or “clean” sign that you can show outside your door', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the receptionist was accommodating and nice', 'service', 'positive'], ['the safety box was not working. so we had to always secure our valuables ourselves', 'experience', 'negative'], ['there was unpleasant smell in the room', 'facility', 'negative'], ['it seems like smoke from outside gets inside our room even if window is closed', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the ac is turned on you can still smell it', 'experience', 'negative'], ['i wish they could put good smell to the room', 'experience', 'neutral']]

When we wanted to stay another extra night, the hotel was full, but he arranged us a room for the same price in the hotel next door. The room itself was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in Ho Chi Minh city! If you can, ask for a room in the back of the building.

274551,The property is beautiful, in an extremely peaceful area. Even though it was winter while we were there, the pool looked gorgeous and we gave the private plunge pool a go too! The food from the restaurant was lovely, and we had all our meals there. The wine list is also excellent! By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff, who went above and beyond to make our stay special. They even surprised me with a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to me at dinner! And they also decorated our room with rose petals and a hand-written card. So special! The only (small) issue we had was in trying to use the wooden bath. It’s BEAUTIFUL but extremely difficult to fill unless you want a pretty cold bath. The hot water runs out too quickly to fill it.

270596,The property was centrally located and tucked away but quiet. It is close to beer street which we thought might have been loud as it is quite busy yet you couldn’t hear any outside noise while in your room. The common facilities were clean and always stocked with supplies. The staff were friendly and accommodating as they helped us book some things we decided to do very last minute. Lee - working the front desk was AMAZING and provided very professional yet personable customer service. The breakfast was tasty as well and reasonably priced. I booked the first portion of our stay on booking. com at a discounted rate. The cost for 3 nights pre booked was the same cost as a 1 night extension that was booked at the hostel. I understand that it may be due to seasonal times of the year with tourism influx but just a heads up - if you know a rough plan of your trip it will save you to pre book on here! ####[['the property was centrally located', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['it is close to beer street', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' we thought might have been loud as it is quite busy yet you couldn’t hear any outside noise while in your room', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the common facilities were clean and always stocked with supplies', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the breakfast was tasty as well and reasonably priced', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff were friendly and accommodating as they helped us book some things we decided to do very last minute', 'service', 'positive'], ['lee - working the front desk was amazing and provided very professional yet personable customer service', 'service', 'positive']]

271365,Large room with huge bed. Mattresses are very firm as is common across SE Asia. Air conditioner so no problems staying cool when needed. Beach area is small but with great sand and is full of small fish/crabs/etc to explore. The resort is extremely quiet, which is what we were looking for. Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful in getting bookings with John's tours, scooter rental, airport shuttles, and we extended our trip 2 days. They even assisted guests who ran low on gas due to gas stations closing early for Tet. Be aware that the walls are paper thin so you will hear anything happening next door - as it was a slow period we were the only ones for most of our stay and only heard neighbors a few times.

270499,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre. It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC. The small taxi rides are absolutely worth being in the quietness and lush green surroundings! ####[['it is located on the quieter side of the river', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions', 'service', 'positive'], [' each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! we stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view', 'facility', 'positive'], ['internet is great', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us', 'service', 'positive'], ['it was such a lovely place to get away from hcmc for a few days', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it is a great value for price', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of ben tre you cannot reach there by public transport from hcmc', 'amenity', 'negative']]

You can literally walk there if you don't mind dragging your luggage. However the hotel provides free shuttle service to and from the airport. Front desk staff really care for their customers. We left very early in the morning and didn't have a chance to use our breakfast (included in rook rate), Front desk office asked the kitchen staff to prepare "take-away" breakfast (club sandwich, bread, butter, fruit, and juice) for us. It was post-covid operation, so the hotel wasn't in full occupation. We arrived very very early, and the e room was available so that let us check in early. (around 10am). This was nice as we were able to take a nap. There are a lot of restaurants that serve local cuisine within 10 mins walk from the hotel. ####[['this location is best if what you are looking for is a good night sleep for your next flight as it is just next to the airport', 'amenity', 'positive'], ["you can see the terminal from the hotel top roof swimming pool. you can literally walk there if you don't mind dragging your luggage", 'amenity', 'positive'], ['however the hotel provides free shuttle service to and from the airport', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['front desk staff really care for their customers', 'service', 'positive'], ['we left very early in the morning and didn\'t have a chance to use our breakfast (included in rook rate), front desk office asked the kitchen staff to prepare "take-away" breakfast', 'service', 'positive'], ['we arrived very very early, and the e room was available so that let us check in early', 'service', 'positive'], ['this was nice as we were able to take a nap', 'experience', 'positive'], ['there are a lot of restaurants that serve local cuisine within 10 mins walk from the hotel', 'amenity', 'positive']]

For example, one of our members starting to throw up during the trek and unfortunately was unable to continue. Kindly, Zizi organized for a taxi to take this member back to the homestay where they could rest. The homestay accommodation was gorgeous and is actually one of the few ran by locals. The view from the room was amazing-rice field upon rice field. The beds were extremely comfortable and we were provided with mosquito nets. The food was incredible, some of the best we’ve eaten in Vietnam (so fresh). The trek itself was great too got to see a lot of ethnic minority villages and on the second day walk through a bamboo forest and to a waterfall. We felt the trek was perhaps slightly of a more advanced level than we originally thought. We (three 21 year old students) found it quite challenging at times and there was not a lot of smooth paths to walk on. We feel this is important to mention as older people or people with perhaps sustained i juried may find this difficult!

271800,Pretty much the perfect stay. This resort is pretty amazing. It's right on the ocean and has got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill, enjoy the sun and read a book. The three restaurants on site are pretty good and the breakfast definitely wins it all. That buffet is the best way to start the day. Room was very comfy, great bed, spacious, clean and with the private pool it was just the cherry on top. But what made our stay even better was the staff. The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel.

273791,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card!

The staff was pleasant and helpful, but communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level. For example, when I was in the taxi, the driver asked them in "Vietnamese" if I could exchange money in the hotel, because I live in Korea and had korean wons, and they said yes no problem, but when I arrived, they said I had to go to Saigon (mainland Vietnam) because they don't exchange korean won in Phu quoc, which I could had already done if I had known this.

The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps.

Compact, yet the building is a beautifully designed oasis in the middle of the chaos of the city. The rooms and common areas are beautiful, the lobby lounge is a lovely cozy area to chill with a cup of coffee or tea. I saw some comments about the breakfast being limited - it is a small selection but is delicious and had some wonderful local classics and coffee, so did not mind it at all. There is also a lovely pool at the roof and small gym, did not use but looks great. Highly recommended and will definitely go back.

271187,Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest.

276528,We loved this homestay! The lady and her husband who own it were very very friendly and made us feel very comfortable in the first 5 minutes of arriving there. The room was probably the best room we have had in vietnam and we have been here for 3 weeks so far. The bathroom is big and open, bedroom has a big comfy bed, lots of storage, fridge and aircon. Amenities were provided, icluding water, coffee sachets, shampoo and shower gel. The room also had a moderately sized balcony facing the street too! The owner made sure we knew if we wanted the rooms cleaned or more towels / toilet roll we should ask her and the location was close to the old town with cafes, convenience stores and ATMS all within walking distance. The owners also helped us organise renting bicycles and scooter and offered to look after our luggage when she found out we had an evening transport time. Overall 10/10 for us.

276951,- Very new hotel, our stay was at the very end of August 2022 and we were told the hotel has only been open for 10 days. - Trendy decorations and good ambiance. - Perfect location to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi. - Good breakfast, we enjoyed the Pho, fresh juices and fruits especially. Restaurant staff extremely friendly. - Adding to the fact that it is new, everything is nice and clean. Every time we were coming back to the hotel after sightseeing in the city, it just felt like a breath of fresh air, since the streets of Hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic, the heat, the trash and vermin, our room in the spotlessly clean hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax. - Staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude. Everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome. Bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street, and they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong.

You can always ask her for the guidance to anywhere around Cao Bang. She even accepted our late check out request when our car only arrived at 2pm. If you need more slippers or change the towels, they could always support. It would be better if there is more dust bin inside the room. There was only 1 in the bathroom when we stayed.

They understood what we were looking for (discovering local culture and beautiful landscape). We went on a very nice hiking day with Thanh and his brother, we highly recommend.- Location is ideal, in Hagiang city, close to everything. It is a quiet place with a nice garden.- Rooms are convenient, with everything needed - The restaurant is nice. We had some home made pizzas but also delicious home made Vietnamese meals with the family.

273510,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access. ####[['nice looking room, spacious with a bath', 'facility', 'positive'], ['our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['this is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning', 'experience', 'negative'], ['people using power tools', 'experience', 'negative'], ['there are rodents in the roof', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the bathroom looks grea', 'facility', 'positive'], ["the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over", 'facility', 'negative'], ['the bath is really nice', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time', 'facility', 'negative'], ['not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty', 'facility', 'negative'], ["staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak english and seemed to struggle with google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all", 'service', 'negative'], ["an example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else", 'experience', 'negative'], ['we had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves', 'service', 'negative'], ["when we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out", 'experience', 'negative'], ['we were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left', 'experience', 'negative'], ['no bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty', 'facility', 'negative'], [" the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them", 'branding', 'negative'], [' so we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins', 'experience', 'negative'], [' this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in vietnam', 'experience', 'negative'], ["don't recommend it at all", 'loyalty', 'negative'], [' if you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access', 'amenity', 'negative']]

270187,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations. ####[["this hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting hanoi as it's very near the lake", 'amenity', 'positive'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel', 'facility', 'positive'], [' it also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks', 'service', 'positive'], ['great staff', 'service', 'positive'], ['one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the skybar and roomservice is the best we had in hanoi', 'service', 'positive'], ['other good things to write about are the spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place', 'service', 'positive'], ['vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the most welcoming staff. will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and hanoi as if he was a tour-guide', 'service', 'positive'], ['he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits', 'service', 'positive'], ['other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect', 'service', 'positive']]

271234,The hotel is brand new and has very helpful staff despite limited English. We were kindly offered a free upgrade on arrival. The complex has 3 very large pools and is located conveniently near the beach and sailing club restaurant Unfortunately/fortunately, this place around the hotel is deserted. Around 95% of the buildings are empty and therefore there is poor choice of restaurants that are much more expensive than you'd expect to pay anywhere else in Vietnam. It is around a 20-30 scooter/taxi ride to the town which can soon become costly. ####[['the hotel is brand new', 'facility', 'positive'], ['has very helpful staff despite limited english', 'service', 'positive'], ['we were kindly offered a free upgrade on arrival', 'service', 'positive'], ['the complex has 3 very large pools and is located conveniently near the beach and sailing club restaurant', 'facility', 'positive']]

272025,The location was quite central so we booked the hotel in believe that it’s a 4 star hotel. But unfortunately it was a complete betray and Desaster. Don’t ever book this hotel! We booked 2 rooms and both were extremely dirty and many things were broken. Furthermore, it’s stated on the internet as a 4 star hotel but it is a betray. When asking the receptionist, he said it’s 3 star and they’re renovating it to turn into 4 star in the future. This is clearly not ok since the price was like a 4 star too. When arriving, the hotelier was unfriendly and wanted to cheat us with a cheaper room without view. But that’s not what we booked. So after some discussion we received the rooms we booked but both were shockingly dirty. Fatty fingerprints everywhere, dust and dirt just like nobody cleaned the rooms for months. We originally booked for 2 nights but had to leave after 7 hours immediately to find a new hotel since it was so gross and we couldn’t sleep the whole night. After addressing these issues to the hotelier he was very rude and still wanted to charge us. It took us half a day to find a new hotel and to discuss those problems and our holidays were ruined.

273071,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station. We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it, fortunately, they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station. We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday. I hope the manager knows what fantastic staff they have, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. ####[['the location is great', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['it’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place', 'experience', 'positive'], ['my family and i had a very comfortable stay at hanoi silk centre hotel', 'branding', 'positive'], ['all the staff are so friendly, especially ms karathy and jay. ms karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to ha long bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived', 'service', 'positive'], ['jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out', 'service', 'positive'], [' the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to hue', 'experience', 'positive'], ['they did find the medication and jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station', 'service', 'positive'], ['he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday', 'service', 'positive']]

276178,We loved everything about this place. We are normally beach or countryside people so a busy city is not normally our thing. But we absolutely loved Hanoi and a lot of it was down to this place. The location is perfect, in the middle of the old quarter set down some small and real Vietnamese back streets. The room was big and very comfortable. We did have some issues initially with the Wi Fi which we need for work but these were resolved straight away and all was fine. The staff were wonderful and couldn't do enough to help us throughout our stay. We loved our stay here so much we have just booked again to return in a few days time which says it all really. Special thank you as well to the wonderful girl on reception in the day who went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay.

It started off with little bit of a snatch theft incident and a police report - their staff stayed with us through all 5 hours and translated everything with the police (thanks Shuang!!). The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit. We subsequently spent dinner tgt, visited their mini farm with two very noisy pigs + embroidery studio.

271204,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said "money,money". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up. I texted the responsible guy and told him this is not acceptable.

They were helpful and so kind. Breakfast buffet was decent, I ate there everyday. Mini stop on the top of the alley and many places to eat nearby. Laundry service is WAY too expensive. I would suggest finding on your own and them having it delivered (I did this). I find the layout of the room a bit odd. Had the deluxe but felt the shower and toilet was too exposed for the room and the bum spray was a little bit too harsh to use easily. Only one elevator but it's not too bad to leave easily.

276287,Nice breakfast. The pool area was ok but not as good as the photo on the website. To be fair this is not my kind of hotel. This is my 8th trip to Vietnam. This is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in in Vietnam and the one I liked the least by a long way. My friend wanted to stay on that street and likes luxury and thought she was getting it based on photos. The hotel was very tired. My room on the 2nd floor was large and had 2 windows that I could not lock (the sliding window was too big for the space). The room was dark 24/7 as the windows looked onto a ventilation well. The bed was comfy enough and the shower hot - although it was inside the bath which I always find dangerous - there were slippery surface signs everywhere so assume there had been some disasters. There were renos at the hotel which we only found out about when we checked in - the room directly above mine was being ripped apart so there were drills, jackhammers etc from 7. 30am to 5pm everyday of our 3 night stay. My friend paid extra for a room with a view on the 8th floor - she looked straight onto a big pillar and the street below - at least she had natural light. We got our rooms at a comparatively very very cheap price during the black friday sales but both agreed we'd paid way too much. The location is nice if you are newby to HCMC and scared of crossing the street but no way is this the real Vietnam - it is cheesy tourist central. Way way better and cheaper hotels in other parts of District 1.

276501,Me and my sister got off a night bus at 4:30am and needed a place to stay. Prior to our night bus the day before we rang up to check if we could check-in late and the staff were very helpful and prompt at responding to our questions via Whats App. Someone then woke up at 4:30am to check us in and reassured us that it was okay if we needed to check out late the next day free of charge so we could get plenty of sleep. The room was spacious and we had a double bed each for a very reasonable price. We were told we could come down for breakfast whenever suited us and then the staff there made us lovely egg baguettes that were included in the price of our stay.

Third morning, shower water was cold. Everything could be better. The name of this hotel is not the White House delux but the White House. Driver spent over half an hour trying to find this hotel because incorrect name. When we finally ascertained that the White House was the hotel that we booked, driver paid the staff out asking why was it called the White House delux, staff just laughed. Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late.

They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests. The dorms are air conditioned, but since the beds are capsule type, there is no ventilation inside the cubicle.

People working there are really nice & police. Laundry service , travel desk available. Wow! They have an airport only 50km away. 50 meters to get to the bus stop and 100. 000 to go to the airport. Please check Van Don airport if you want go to Ho Chi Minh city from Ha Long bay, it is cheaper than from Ha Noi a lot.

271338,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

271893,Hotel is brand new, nice and clean. Located just near the center and by the sea at the same time, so you don’t need to search for nice beach or place to eat, everything is near. Airport is also 10 min driving from the hotel. Great view from the balcony. I didn’t hear any noise. Breakfast is very poor, no choice, few Vietnamese dishes. It’s ok for family-run boutique hotel, but for such big one breakfast definitely need improvements. Bikes for rent are in very bad conditions.

As for communication I used to write directly to the guy in whatsapp in English and it worked very well. If you are a nature lover, you can't miss this stage. I had a hard time figuring out how to get there, better to contact the facility in advance and ask for directions. Pu Luong as far as tourism is concerned is not yet developed e. g. with already organized tours, you have to plan well for travel within and figure out what you want to see maybe ask the family for advice in advance.

Unfortunately, I hated to start and waste my vacation in Hanoi this way so I left to find another hotel. Came back after a couple of hours to check out of my original 4 nights.

276066,We had a great stay at Bare Han during our four nights in Da Nang. I believe they have four rooms at the property, three of them in one building, and a fourth right next door (the Ground Floor Room). We stayed in the Ground Floor Room, which may have some differences from the other three. We were very happy with the room. It is spacious, the bed is comfortable, and the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things - and two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices. The shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around Southeast Asia, and very stable temperature control. The shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld. There is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop, and there is also a small table with two chairs for dining or drinking coffee. The internet was good enough that I could play a fairly bandwidth-heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon. It is easy to get to this place by simply asking your driver to take you to the Da Nang Cathedral. The address provided by the property also worked with our airport taxi, who dropped us at the cathedral. Immediately across the street from the cathedral is an alley with a red banner over it that leads to the building. This alley also has a dessert shop (Mlem Pudding) right across from the Bare Han building, and a coffee shop. The location is excellent, with a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance, and several Pho and Banh Mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left. There are several coffee shops in the area. We recommend An Le Cafe if you don't mind sitting outdoors with a fan (“Anle Cafe” on Google Maps). If you want air conditioning, Traditional Coffee is around the corner and at the end of the next block. If you need to do laundry while you are here, we took ours to “Co So Giat Uit Hap Minh Trang” at 76 Tran Quoc Toan. This particular room only had two drawbacks, that were not really a problem for us. The first is that the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building, that is less than a meter away. They have put plants in the space, as well as lights, which is a nice solution, but there is very little natural light and you cannot tell how the weather is without opening the front door. The room itself has plenty of artificial light, though. I believe the other three rooms in the main building have windows that look out toward the more spacious alley, but I'm not sure. The only other negative is that the toilet and shower have glass doors. You can draw some curtains around the area outside these two stalls for more privacy, but they are not fully opaque. The toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down, and these provide full privacy while in the stalls. ####[['we had a great stay at bare han during our four nights in da nang', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we were very happy with the room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it is spacious', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the bed is comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things', 'facility', 'positive'], ['two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around southeast asia', 'facility', 'positive'], ['stable temperature control', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the internet was good enough', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i could play a fairly bandwidth-heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the location is excellent', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance, and several pho and banh mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there are several coffee shops in the area', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building, that is less than a meter away', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the toilet and shower have glass doors', 'facility', 'negative'], ['they are not fully opaque', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down, and these provide full privacy while in the stalls', 'facility', 'positive']]

The room (double room with private bathroom) was EXTREMELY noisy - and this is coming someone who isn't very sensitive to noise/can sleep almost everywhere. I understand it's impossible for it to be completely quiet as the room faces the street and is opposite a school but better windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out. On top of that, there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors. I didn't mind this so much but I know this is important to some people - the water pressure in the shower is weak. ####[['the room itself was very spacious - seating area with sofa, bed, dining table, pantry area, bathroom', 'facility', 'positive'], ['basic toiletries and towels were provided', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['location was good - lots of food options and cafes around, not too far from the heart of d1', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['internet was reliable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['was extremely noisy', 'experience', 'positive'], ['windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the water pressure in the shower is weak', 'facility', 'negative'], [' the room faces the street and is opposite a school', 'amenity', 'negative']]

273915,We had 2 rooms with street view. The rooms were a bit musty but once the aircon kicked in it wasn't too bad. Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room. There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap. The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there, just empty rooms. Reception was on 1st floor.

Finally, we booked a free walking tour with Yam and Dong through Tripadviser.

270879,We like the location of this hotel. It is very close to the center but not noisy. The staffs are friendly and helpful and they arrange activities like basket boat tour and cooking lessons. If you are staying in this hotel, I highly recommend booking the combined basket boat tour and cooking lessons with Mr Cu. It was fun for us. We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us. We feel that it is very intrusive and not professional. ####[['we like the location of this hotel. it is very close to the center but not noisy', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the staffs are friendly and helpful and they arrange activities like basket boat tour and cooking lessons', 'service', 'positive'], ['we were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we asked to be transfered to another room and they did', 'service', 'positive'], ['the next room was okay but i woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again', 'facility', 'negative'], [' i hope they will make some updates of the building', 'facility', 'neutral'], [' the breakfast is okay but a bit limited', 'service', 'negative'], ['we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive', 'service', 'negative'], ['we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us', 'service', 'negative'], ['hey keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. i mean, i understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff', 'service', 'negative'], ['the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review', 'service', 'negative'], ['we feel that it is very intrusive and not professional', 'experience', 'negative']]

270959,Loved the value for money. To have your own room in district one not more than 10 min walk from walking street and the busy bar and restaurant area is super for the price. In a authentic Vietnamese alley and market street locale. Room was a good size. Air conditioning worked well and a nice bathroom. Good work space and table with chairs. View of the city. It's probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower. Would suit a long stay. Like a month to really emmerse in the city or if you had studies to do. Would recommend this hostel/hotel. They take visa and card payments which is great option. Like most things really at this price point. But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor, was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen. But it did lock! The other doors seemed in better shape.

They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond. This hostel isn’t the same one that all the reviews rave about because they moved during Covid. Booking’s description says there’s a patio bar and has lots of reviews talk about the roof, and at this location those don’t exist. Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning. Not ideal. We did the classic Mr. Peace tour, which was okay but on the pricier side compared to the rest of vietnam. 35$ for the day, which didn’t include meals, weasel coffee, or gas if you drive yourself. You get to see a lot though which is cool. ####[['very clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['staff is very nice and family dinners were very delicious', 'service', 'positive'], ['an helped us check in really early in the morning and kept checking with us during the whole stay, which was lovely', 'service', 'positive'], ['they dropped me off at the bus station for mui ne which was above and beyond', 'service', 'positive'], ['we did the classic mr. peace tour, which was okay but on the pricier side compared to the rest of vietnam', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['35$ for the day, which didn’t include meals, weasel coffee, or gas if you drive yourself', 'experience', 'neutral'], [' you get to see a lot though which is cool', 'experience', 'positive']]
273149,The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is good, the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. It's quite cheap. The mattress in the room was horrible. There was a huge dent in the center. At the time the hotel was being renovated, so maybe they would have changed it out, but I think they didn't. The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes. I literally paid a quarter of that for the same load in Hanoi's Old quarter.

I have stayed at the hotel twice and both times had difficulty flushing minimal amounts of toilet paper, even after 2 or 3 flushes. It's very odd. When hotel is full of families on a holiday weekend, there is a bad shortage of seating at swimming pool. Perhaps more or different kinds of pool furniture can be added. The reception desk wanted to collect a 20 million VND deposit for incidentals. I travel to 5 star properties around Vietnam and find that to be insulting and exorbitant. I refused and was registered on a cash only basis.

270413,Staff was great and super helpful. Breakfast was good, it was nice that you can order different dishes every morning from the menu on top of the buffet. Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far. I had to lower the grade because we didn’t appreciate this kind of doing. ####[['staff was great and super helpful. breakfast was good, it was nice that you can order different dishes every morning from the menu on top of the buffet', 'service', 'positive'], ['location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away', 'amenity', 'positive'], [' room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc', 'facility', 'negative'], ['you could hear all the noises from the hallway. the walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep', 'experience', 'negative']]
